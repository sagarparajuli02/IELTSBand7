        <span style="color: #ff0000; font-size: 14pt;"><strong>THE LITTLE ICE AGE</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;This book will provide a detailed
        examination of the Little Ice Age and other climatic shifts, but, before I embark on that,
        let me provide a historical context. We tend to think of climate – as opposed to weather –
        as something unchanging, yet humanity has been at the mercy of climate change for its entire
        existence, with at least eight glacial episodes in the past 730,000 years. Our ancestors
        adapted to the universal but irregular global warming since the end of the last great Ice
        Age, around 10,000 years ago, with dazzling opportunism. They developed strategies for
        surviving harsh drought cycles, decades of heavy rainfall or unaccustomed cold; adopted
        agriculture and stock-raising, which revolutionised human life; and founded the world’s
        first pre-industrial civilisations in Egypt, Mesopotamia and the Americas. But the price of
        sudden climate change, in famine, disease and suffering, was often high.</p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;The Little Ice Age lasted from roughly
        1300 until the middle of the nineteenth century. Only two centuries ago, Europe experienced
        a cycle of bitterly cold winters; mountain glaciers in the Swiss Alps were the lowest in
        recorded memory, and pack ice surrounded Iceland for much of the year. The climatic events
        of the Little Ice Age did more than help shape the modern world. They are the deeply
        important context for the current unprecedented global warming. The Little Ice Age was far
        from a deep freeze, however; rather an irregular seesaw of rapid climatic shifts, few
        lasting more than a quarter-century, driven by complex and still little understood
        interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. The seesaw brought cycles of intensely
        cold winters and easterly winds, then switched abruptly to years of heavy spring and early
        summer rains, mild winters, and frequent Atlantic storms, or to periods of droughts, light
        northeasterly winds, and summer heat waves.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong>Reconstructing the climate changes of
        the past is extremely difficult, because systematic weather observations began only a few
        centuries ago, in Europe and North America. Records from India and tropical Africa are even
        more recent. For the time before records began, we have only ‘proxy records’ reconstructed
        largely from tree rings and ice cores, supplemented by a few incomplete written accounts. We
        now have hundreds of tree-ring records from throughout the northern hemisphere, and many
        from south of the equator, too, amplified with a growing body of temperature data from ice
        cores drilled in Antarctica, Greenland, the Peruvian Andes, and other locations. We are
        close to a knowledge of annual summer and winter temperature variations over much of the
        northern hemisphere going back 600 years.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D</strong>&nbsp;This book is a narrative history of
        climatic shifts during the past ten centuries, and some of the ways in which people in
        Europe adapted to them. Part One describes the Medieval Warm Period, roughly 900 to 1200.
        During these three centuries, Norse voyagers from Northern Europe explored northern seas,
        settled Greenland, and visited North America. It was not a time of uniform warmth, for then,
        as always since the Great Ice Age, there were constant shifts in rainfall and temperature.
        Mean European temperatures were about the same as today, perhaps slightly cooler.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E.</strong>&nbsp;It is known that the Little Ice Age
        cooling began in Greenland and the Arctic in about 1200. As the Arctic ice pack spread
        southward, Norse voyages to the west were rerouted into the open Atlantic, then ended
        altogether. Storminess increased in the North Atlantic and North Sea. Colder, much wetter
        weather descended on Europe between 1315 and 1319, when thousands perished in a
        continent-wide famine. By 1400, the weather had become decidedly more unpredictable and
        stormier, with sudden shifts and lower temperatures that culminated in the cold decades of
        the late sixteenth century. Fish were a vital commodity in growing towns and cities, where
        food supplies were a constant concern. Dried cod and herring were already the staples of the
        European fish trade, but changes in water temperatures forced fishing fleets to work further
        offshore. The Basques, Dutch, and English developed the first offshore fishing boats adapted
        to a colder and stormier Atlantic. A gradual agricultural revolution in northern Europe
        stemmed from concerns over food supplies at a time of rising populations. The revolution
        involved intensive commercial farming and the growing of animal fodder on land not
        previously used for crops. The increased productivity from farmland made some countries
        self-sufficient in grain and livestock and offered effective protection against famine.
    </p>
    <p><strong>F.</strong>&nbsp;Global temperatures began to rise slowly after 1850, with the
        beginning of the Modern Warm Period. There was a vast migration from Europe by land-hungry
        farmers and others, to which the famine caused by the Irish potato blight contributed, to
        North America, Australia, New Zealand, and southern Africa. Millions of hectares of forest
        and woodland fell before the newcomers’ axes between 1850 and 1890, as intensive European
        farming methods expanded across the world. The unprecedented land clearance released vast
        quantities of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, triggering for the first time humanly
        caused global warming. Temperatures climbed more rapidly in the twentieth century as the use
        of fossil fuels proliferated and greenhouse gas levels continued to soar. The rise has been
        even steeper since the early 1980s. The Little Ice Age has given way to a new climatic
        regime, marked by prolonged and steady warming. At the same time, extreme weather events
        like Category 5 hurricanes are becoming more frequent.

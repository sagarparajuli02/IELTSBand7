    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>You should spend about 20 minutes on Questions 1-14
        which are based on the Reading Passage below.</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><strong>Dressed to Dazzle</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As high-tech materials invade high-street fashion, prepare for
        clothes that are cooler than silk and warmer than wool, keep insects at arm’s length, and
        emit many pinpricks of coloured light.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The convergence of fashion and high technology is leading to new
        kinds of fibres, fabrics and coatings that are imbuing clothing with equally wondrous
        powers. Corpe Nove, an Italian fashion company, has made a prototype shirt that shortens its
        sleeves when room temperature rises and can be ironed with a hairdryer. And at Nexia
        Biotechnologies, a Canadian firm, scientists have caused a stir by manufacturing spider silk
        from the milk of genetically engineered goats. Not surprisingly, some industry analysts
        think high-tech materials may soon influence fashion more profoundly than any individual
        designer.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">A big impact is already being made at the molecular level.
        Nano-Tex, a subsidiary of American textiles maker Burlington, markets a portfolio of
        nanotechnologies that can make fabrics more durable, comfortable, wrinkle-free and
        stain-resistant. The notion of this technology posing a threat to the future of the clothing
        industry clearly does not worry popular fashion outlets such as Gap, Levi Strauss and Lands’
        End, all of which employ Nano-Tex’s products. Meanwhile, Schoeller Textil in Germany, whose
        clients include famous designers Donna Karan and Polo Ralph Lauren, uses nanotechnology to
        create fabrics that can store or release heat.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Sensory Perception Technologies (Spn embodies an entirely
        different application of nanotechnology. Created in 2003 by Quest International, a flavour
        and fragrance company, and Woolmark, a wool textile organisation, SPT is a new technique of
        embedding chemicals into fabric. Though not the first of this type, SPT’s durability
        (evidently the microcapsule containing the chemicals can survive up to 30 washes) suggests
        an interesting future. Designers could incorporate signature scents into their collections.
        Sportswear could be impregnated with anti-perspirant. Hayfever sufferers might find relief
        by pulling on a T-shirt, and so on.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The loudest buzz now surrounds polylactic acid (PLA) fibres –
        and, in particular, one brand-named Ingeo. Developed by Cargill Dow, it is the first
        man-made fibre derived from a 100% annually renewable resource. This is currently maize
        (corn), though in theory any fermentable plant material, even potato peelings, can be used.
        In performance terms, the attraction for the 30-plus clothes makers signed up to use Ingeo
        lies in its superiority over polyester (which it was designed to replace).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">As Philippa Watkins, a textiles specialist, notes, Ingeo is not
        a visual trend. Unlike nanotechnology, which promises to ‘transform what clothes can do,
        Ingeo’s impact on fashion will derive instead from its emphasis on using natural sustainable
        resources. Could wearing synthetic fabrics made from polluting and non-renewable fossil
        fuels become as uncool as slipping on a coat made from animal fur? Consumers should expect a
        much wider choice of ‘green’ fabrics. Alongside PLA fibres, firms are investigating plants
        such as bamboo, seaweed, nettles and banana stalks as raw materials for textiles. Soya bean
        fibre is also gaining ground. Harvested in China and spun in Europe, the fabric is a better
        absorber and ventilator than silk, and retains heat better than wool.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Elsewhere, fashion houses – among them Ermenegildo Zegna, Paul
        Smith and DKNY – are combining fashion with electronics. Clunky earlier attempts Involved
        attaching electronic components to the fabrics after the normal weaving process. But
        companies such as SOFTswitch have developed electro-conductive fabrics that behave in
        similar ways to conventional textiles.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Could electronic garments one day change colour or pattern? A
        hint of what could be achieved is offered by Luminex, a joint venture between Stabio Textile
        and Caen. Made of woven optical fibres and powered by a small battery, Luminex fabric emits
        thousands of pinpricks of light, the colour of which can be varied. Costumes made of the
        fabric wowed audiences at a production of the opera Aida in Washington, DC, last year.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Yet this ultimate of ambitions has remained elusive in daily
        fashion, largely because electronic textiles capable of such wizardry are still too fragile
        to wear. Margaret Orth, whose firm International Fashion Machines makes a colour-changing
        fabric, believes the capability is a decade or two away. Accessories with this
        chameleon-like capacity – for instance, a handbag that alters its colour – are more likely
        to appear first.

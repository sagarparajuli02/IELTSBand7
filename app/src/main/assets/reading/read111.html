    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt;"><em><strong>The meaning and power of smell</strong></em></span>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><em><strong>T<span style="font-size: 10pt;">he sense of smell, or olfaction, is powerful. Odours affect us on a physical, psychological and social level. For the most part, however, we breathe in the aromas which surround us without being consciously aware of their importance to us. It is only when the faculty of smell is impaired for some reason that we begin to realise the essential role the sense of smell plays in our sense of well-being.</span></strong></em>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;A survey conducted by Anthony Synott at
        Montreal’s Concordia University asked participants to comment on how important smell was to
        them in their lives. It became apparent that smell can evoke strong emotional responses. A
        scent associated with a good experience can bring a rush of joy, while a foul odour or one
        associated with a bad memory may make us grimace with disgust. Respondents to the survey
        noted that many of their olfactory likes and dislikes were based on emotional associations.
        Such associations can be powerful enough so that odours that we would generally label
        unpleasant become agreeable, and those that we would generally consider fragrant become
        disagreeable for particular individuals. The perception of smell, therefore, consists not
        only of the sensation of the odours themselves, but of the experiences and emotions
        associated with them.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;Odours are also essential cues in
        social bonding. One respondent to the survey believed that there is no true emotional
        bonding without touching and smelling a loved one. In fact, infants recognise the odours of
        their mothers soon after birth and adults can often identify their children or spouses by
        scent. In one well-known test, women and men were able to distinguish by smell alone
        clothing worn by their marriage partners from similar clothing worn by other people. Most of
        the subjects would probably never have given much thought to odour as a cue for identifying
        family members before being involved in the test, but as the experiment revealed, even when
        not consciously considered, smells register.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;In spite of its importance to our
        emotional and sensory lives, smell is probably the most undervalued sense in many cultures.
        The reason often given for the low regard in which smell is held is that, in comparison with
        its importance among animals, the human sense of smell is feeble and undeveloped. While it
        is true that the olfactory powers of humans are nothing like as fine as those possessed by
        certain animals, they are still remarkably acute. Our noses are able to recognise thousands
        of smells, and to perceive odours which are present only in extremely small quantities.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;Smell, however, is a highly elusive
        phenomenon. Odours, unlike colours, for instance, cannot be named in many languages because
        the specific vocabulary simply doesn’t exist. ‘It smells like … ,’ we have to say when
        describing an odour, struggling to express our olfactory experience. Nor can odours be
        recorded: there is no effective way to either capture or store them over time In the realm
        of olfaction, we must make do with descriptions and recollections. This has implications for
        olfactory research.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E.</strong>&nbsp;Most of the research on smell
        undertaken to date has been of a physical scientific nature. Significant advances have been
        made in the understanding of the biological and chemical nature of olfaction, but many
        fundamental questions have yet to be answered. Researchers have still to decide whether
        smell is one sense or two – one responding to odours proper and the other registering
        odourless chemicals in the air. Other unanswered questions are whether the nose is the only
        part of the body affected by odours, and how smells can be measured objectively given the
        nonphysical components. Questions like these mean that interest in the psychology of smell
        is inevitably set to play an increasingly important role for researchers.
    </p>
    <p><strong>F.</strong>&nbsp;However, smell is not simply a biological and psychological
        phenomenon. Smell is cultural, hence it is a social and historical phenomenon. Odours are
        invested with cultural values: smells that are considered to be offensive in some cultures
        may be perfectly acceptable in others. Therefore, our sense of smell is a means of, and
        model for, interacting with the world. Different smells can provide us with intimate and
        emotionally charged experiences and the value that we attach to these experiences is
        interiorised by the members of society in a deeply personal way. Importantly, our commonly
        held feelings about smells can help distinguish us from other cultures. The study of the
        cultural history of smell is, therefore, in a very real sense, an investigation into the
        essence of human culture.

        style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>DELIVERING THE GOODS</strong></span>
</p>
<p><strong>The vast expansion in international trade owes much to a revolution in the business of
    moving freight</strong>
</p>
<p><strong>A.&nbsp;</strong>International trade is growing at a startling pace. While the global
    economy has been expanding at a bit over 3% a year, the volume of trade has been rising at a
    compound annual rate of about twice that. Foreign products, from meat to machinery, play a more
    important role in almost every economy in the world, and foreign markets now tempt businesses
    that never much worried about sales beyond their nation’s borders.
</p>
<p><strong>B</strong>. What lies behind this explosion in international commerce? The general
    worldwide decline in trade barriers, such as customs duties and import quotas, is surely one
    explanation. The economic opening of countries that have traditionally been minor players is
    another. But one force behind the import-export boom has passed all but unnoticed: the rapidly
    falling cost of getting goods to market. Theoretically, in the world of trade, shipping costs do
    not matter. Goods, once they have been made, are assumed to move instantly and at no cost from
    place to place. The real world, however, is full of frictions. Cheap labour may make Chinese
    clothing competitive in America, but if delays in shipment tie up working capital and cause
    winter coats to arrive in spring, trade may lose its advantages.
</p>
<p><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong>At the turn of the 20th century, agriculture and manufacturing were the
    two most important sectors almost everywhere, accounting for about 70% of total output in
    Germany, Italy and France, and 40-50% in America, Britain and Japan. International commerce was
    therefore dominated by raw materials, such as wheat, wood and iron ore, or processed
    commodities, such as meat and steel. But these sorts of products are heavy and bulky and the
    cost of transporting them relatively high.
</p>
<p><strong>D.&nbsp;</strong>Countries still trade disproportionately with their geographic
    neighbours. Over time, however, world output has shifted into goods whose worth is unrelated to
    their size and weight. Today, it is finished manufactured products that dominate the flow of
    trade, and, thanks to technological advances such as lightweight components, manufactured goods
    themselves have tended to become lighter and less bulky. As a result, less transportation is
    required for every dollar’s worth of imports or exports.
</p>
<p><strong>E</strong>. To see how this influences trade, consider the business of making disk drives
    for computers. Most of the world’s disk-drive manufacturing is concentrated in South-east Asia.
    This is possible only because disk drives, while valuable, are small and light and so cost
    little to ship. Computer manufacturers in Japan or Texas will not face hugely bigger freight
    bills if they import drives from Singapore rather than purchasing them on the domestic market.
    Distance therefore poses no obstacle to the globalisation of the disk-drive industry.
</p>
<p><strong>F</strong>. This is even more true of the fast-growing information industries. Films and
    compact discs cost little to transport, even by aeroplane. Computer software can be ‘exported’
    without ever loading it onto a ship, simply by transmitting it over telephone lines from one
    country to another, so freight rates and cargo-handling schedules become insignificant factors
    in deciding where to make the product. Businesses can locate based on other considerations, such
    as the availability of labour, while worrying less about the cost of delivering their output.
</p>
<p><strong>G</strong>. In many countries deregulation has helped to drive the process along. But,
    behind the scenes, a series of technological innovations known broadly as containerisation and
    inter-modal transportation has led to swift productivity improvements in cargo-handling. Forty
    years ago, the process of exporting or importing involved a great many stages of handling, which
    risked portions of the shipment being damaged or stolen along the way. The invention of the
    container crane made it possible to load and unload containers without capsizing the ship and
    the adoption of standard container sizes allowed almost any box to be transported on any ship.
    By 1967, dual-purpose ships, carrying loose cargo in the hold* and containers on the deck, were
    giving way to all-container vessels that moved thousands of boxes at a time.
</p>
<p><strong>H.&nbsp;</strong>The shipping container transformed ocean shipping into a highly
    efficient, intensely competitive business. But getting the cargo to and from the dock was a
    different story. National governments, by and large, kept a much firmer hand on truck and
    railroad tariffs than on charges for ocean freight. This started changing, however, in the
    mid-1970s, when America began to deregulate its transportation industry. First airlines, then
    road hauliers and railways, were freed from restrictions on what they could carry, where they
    could haul it and se what price they could charge. Big productivity gains resulted. Between 1985
    and 1996, for example, America’s freight railways dramatically reduced their employment,
    trackage, and their fleets of locomotives – while increasing the amount of cargo they hauled.
    Europe’s railways have also shown marked, albeit smaller, productivity improvements.
</p>
<p><strong>I.&nbsp;</strong>In America the period of huge productivity gains in transportation may
    be almost over, but in most countries the process still has far to go. State ownership of
    railways and airlines, regulation of freight rates and toleration of anti-competitive practices,
    such as cargo-handling monopolies, all keep the cost of shipping unnecessarily high and deter
    international trade. Bringing these barriers down would help the world’s economies grow even
    closer.

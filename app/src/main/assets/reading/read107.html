    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;A.&nbsp;</strong>If you took off your skin and
        laid it flat, it would cover an area of about twenty-one square feet, making it by far the
        body’s largest organ. Draped in place over our bodies, skin forms the barrier between what’s
        inside us and what’s outside. It protects us from a multitude of external forces. It serves
        as an avenue to our most intimate physical and psychological selves.
    </p>
    <p><strong>B.&nbsp;</strong>This impervious yet permeable barrier, less than a millimetre thick
        in places, is composed of three layers. The outermost layer is the bloodless epidermis. The
        dermis includes collagen, elastin, and nerve endings. The innermost layer, subcutaneous fat,
        contains tissue that acts as an energy source, cushion and insulator for the body.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong>From these familiar characteristics of
        skin emerge the profound mysteries of touch, arguably our most essential source of sensory
        stimulation. We can live without seeing or hearing – in fact, without any of our other
        senses. But babies born without effective nerve connections between skin and brain can fail
        to thrive and may even die.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D.&nbsp;</strong>Laboratory experiments decades ago, now
        considered unethical and inhumane, kept baby monkeys from being touched by their mothers. It
        made no difference that the babies could see, hear and smell their mothers; without
        touching, the babies became apathetic, and failed to progress.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E.&nbsp;</strong>For humans, insufficient touching in
        early years can have lifelong results. “In touching cultures, adult aggression is low,
        whereas in cultures where touch is limited, adult aggression is high,” writes Tiffany Field,
        director of the Touch Research Institutes at the University of Miami School of Medicine.
        Studies of a variety of cultures show a correspondence between high rates of physical
        affection in childhood and low rates of adult physical violence.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>F.&nbsp;</strong>While the effects of touching are easy
        to understand, the mechanics of it are less so. “Your skin has millions of nerve cells of
        various shapes at different depths,” explains Stanley Bolanowski, a neuroscientist and
        associate director of the Institute for Sensory Research at Syracuse University. “When the
        nerve cells are stimulated, physical energy is transformed into energy used by the nervous
        system and passed from the skin to the spinal cord and brain. It’s called transduction, and
        no one knows exactly how it takes place.” Suffice it to say that the process involves the
        intricate, splitsecond operation of a complex system of signals between neurons in the skin
        and brain.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>G.&nbsp;</strong>This is starting to sound very
        confusing until Bolanowski says: “In simple terms people perceive three basic things via
        skin: pressure, temperature, and pain.” And then I’m sure he’s wrong. “When I get wet, my
        skin feels wet,” I protest. “Close your eyes and lean back,” says Bolanowski.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>H.&nbsp;</strong>Something cold and wet is on my
        forehead – so wet, in fact, that I wait for water to start dripping down my cheeks. “Open
        your eyes.” Bolanowski says, showing me that the sensation comes from a chilled, but dry,
        metal cylinder. The combination of pressure and cold, he explains, is what makes my skin
        perceive wetness. He gives me a surgical glove to put on and has me put a finger in a glass
        of cold water. My finger feels wet, even though I have visual proof that it’s not touching
        water. My skin, which seemed so reliable, has been deceiving me my entire life. When I
        shower or wash my hands, I now realize, my skin feels pressure and temperature. It’s my
        brain that says I feel wet.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>I.&nbsp;</strong>Perceptions of pressure, temperature
        and pain manifest themselves in many different ways. Gentle stimulation of pressure
        receptors can result in ticklishness; gentle stimulation of pain receptors, in itching. Both
        sensations arise from a neurological transmission, not from something that physically
        exists. Skin, I’m realizing, is under constant assault, both from within the body and from
        forces outside. Repairs occur with varying success.
    </p>
    <p><strong>J.&nbsp;</strong>Take the spot where I nicked myself with a knife while slicing
        fruit. I have a crusty scab surrounded by pink tissue about a quarter inch long on my right
        palm. Under the scab, epidermal cells are migrating into the wound to close it up. When the
        process is complete, the scab will fall off to reveal new epidermis. It’s only been a few
        days, but my little self-repair is almost complete. Likewise, we recover quickly from slight
        burns. If you ever happen to touch a hot burner, just put your finger in cold water. The
        chances are you will have no blister, little pain and no scar. Severe burns, though, are a
        different matter.

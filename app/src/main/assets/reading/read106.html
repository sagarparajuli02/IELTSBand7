    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;"><strong>Colorblindness</strong></span>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A</strong>. Myths related to the causes and symptoms of
        “colorblindness” abound throughout the world. The term itself is misleading, since it is
        extremely rare for anyone to have a complete lack of color perception. By look ing into the
        myths related to color blindness, one can learn many facts about the structure and genetics
        o the human eye. It is a myth that colorblind people see the world as if it were a black and
        white movie. There are very few cases of complete colorblindness. Those who have a complete
        lack of color perception are referred to as monochromatics, and usually have a serious
        problem with their overall vision as well as an inability to see colors. The fact is that in
        most cases of colorblindness, there are only certain shades that a person cannot distinguish
        between. These people are said to be dichromatic. They may not be able to tell the
        difference between red and green, or orange and yellow. A person with normal color vision
        has what is called trichromatic vision. The difference between the three levels of color
        perception have to do with the cones in the human eye. A normal human eye has three cones
        located inside the retina: the red cone, the green cone, and the yellow cone. Each cone
        contains a specific pigment whose function is to absorb the light of these colors and the
        combinations of them. People with trichromatic vision have all three cones in working order.
        When one of the three cones does not function properly, dichromatic vision occurs.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B</strong>. Some people believe that only men can be
        colorblind. This is also a myth, though it is not completely untrue. In an average
        population, 8% of males exhibit some form of colorblindness, while only 0.5% of women do.
        While there may be some truth to the idea that more men have trouble matching their clothing
        than women, the reason that color vision deficiency is predominant in males has nothing to
        do with fashion. The fact is that the gene for color blindness is located on the X
        chromosome, which men only have one of. Females have two X chromosomes, and if one carries
        the defective gene, the other one naturally compensates. Therefore, the only way for a
        female to inherit colorblindness is for both of her X chromosomes to carry the defective
        gene. This is why the incidence of color deficiency is sometimes more prevalent in extremely
        small societies that have a limited gene pool.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C</strong>. It is true that all babies are born
        colorblind. A baby’s cones do not begin to differentiate between many different colors until
        he is approximately four months old. This is why many of the modern toys for very young
        babies consist of black and white patterns or primary colors, rather than traditional soft
        pastels. However, some current research points to the importance of developing an infant’s
        color visual system. In 2004, Japanese researcher Yoichi Sugita of the Neuroscience Research
        Institute performed an experiment that would suggest that color vision deficiency isn’t
        entirely genetic. In his experiment, he subjected a group of baby monkeys to monochromatic
        lighting for one year. He later compared their vision to normal monkey who had experienced
        the colorful world outdoors. It was found that the test monkeys were unable to perform the
        color-matching tasks that the normal monkeys could. Nevertheless, most cases of
        colorblindness are attributed to genetic factors that are present at birth.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D</strong>. Part of the reason there are so many
        inconsistencies related to colorblindness, or “color vision deficiency” as it is called in
        the medical world, is that it is difficult to know exactly which colors each human can see.
        Children are taught from a very young age that an apple is red. Naming colors allows
        children to associate a certain shade with a certain name, regardless of a color vision
        deficiency. Someone who never takes a color test can go through life thinking that what they
        see as red is called green. Children are generally tested for colorblindness at about four
        years of age. The Ishihara Test is the most common, though it is highly criticized’ because
        it requires that children have the ability to recognize numerals. In the Ishihara Test, a
        number made up of colored dots is hidden inside a series of dots of a different shade. Those
        with normal vision can distinguish the number from the background, while those with color
        vision deficiency will only see the dots.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E.&nbsp;</strong>While many of the myths related to
        colorblindness have been busted by modern science, there are still a few remaining beliefs
        that require more research in order to be labeled as folklore. For example, there is a
        long-standing belief that colorblindness can aid military soldiers because it gives them the
        ability to see through camouflage. Another belief is that everyone becomes colorblind in an
        emergency situation. The basis of this idea is that a catastrophic event can overwhelm the
        brain, causing it to utilize only those receptors needed to perform vital tasks. In general,
        identifying color is not considered an essential task in a life or death situation.

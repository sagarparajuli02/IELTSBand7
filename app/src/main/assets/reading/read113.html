            style="font-size: 18pt;">The history of the biro</span></strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A.</strong> One chilly autumn morning in 1945, five
        thousand shoppers crowded the pavements outside Gimbels Department Store in New York City.
        The day before, Gimbels had taken out a full-page newspaper advertisement in the New York
        Times, announcing the sale of the first ballpoint pens in the United States. The new writing
        instrument was heralded as “fantastic … miraculous … guaranteed to write for two years
        without refilling!” Within six hours, Gimbels had sold its entire stock of ten thousand
        ballpoints at $12.50 each – approximately $130 at today’s prices.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B.</strong> In fact this ‘new’ pen was not new after
        all, and was just the latest development in a long search for the best way to deliver ink to
        paper. In 1884 Lewis Waterman had patented the fountain pen, giving him the sole rights to
        manufacture it. This marked a significant leap forward in writing technology, but fountain
        pens soon became notorious for leaking. In 1888, a leather tanner named John Loud devised
        and patented the first “rolling-pointed marker pen” for marking leather. Loud’s design
        contained a reservoir of ink in a cartridge and a rotating ball point that was constantly
        bathed on one side with ink.&nbsp; Loud’s pen was never manufactured, however, and over the
        next five decades, 350 additional patents were issued for similar ball-type pens, though
        none advanced beyond the design stage. Each had their own faults, but the major difficulty
        was the ink: if the ink was thin, the pens leaked, and if it was too thick, they clogged.
        Depending on the climate or air temperature, sometimes the pens would do both.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C.</strong> Almost fifty years later, Ladislas and Georg
        Biro, two Hungarian brothers, came up with a solution to this problem. In 1935 Ladislas Biro
        was working as a journalist, editing a small newspaper. He found himself becoming more and
        more frustrated by the amount of time he wasted filling fountain pens with ink and cleaning
        up ink smudges. What’s more, the sharp tip of his fountain pen often scratched or tore
        through the thin newsprint paper. Ladislas and Georg (a chemist) set about making models of
        new pen designs and creating better inks to use in them. Ladislas had observed that the type
        of ink used in newspaper printing dried rapidly, leaving the paper dry and smudge-free. He
        was determined to construct a pen using the same type of ink. However, the thicker ink would
        not flow from a regular pen nib so he had to develop a new type of point. Biro came up with
        the idea of fitting his pen with a tiny ball bearing in its tip. As the pen moved along the
        paper, the ball bearing rotated and picked up ink from the ink cartridge which it delivered
        to the paper.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D.</strong> The first Biro pen, like the designs that
        had gone before it. relied on gravity for the ink to flow to the ball bearing at the tip.
        This meant that the pens only worked when they were held straight up, and even then the ink
        flow was sometimes too heavy, leaving big smudges of ink on the paper. The Biro brothers had
        a rethink and eventually devised a new design, which relied on capillary action rather than
        gravity to feed the ink. This meant that the ink could flow more smoothly to the tip and the
        pen could be held at an angle rather than straight up. In 1938, as World War II broke out,
        the Biro brothers fled to Argentina, where they applied for a patent for their pen and
        established their first factory.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E.&nbsp;</strong> The Biros’ pen soon came to the
        attention of American fighter pilots, who needed a new kind of pen to use at high altitudes.
        Apparently, it was ideal for pilots as it did not leak like the fountain pen and did not
        have to be refilled frequently. The United States Department of War contacted several
        American companies, asking them to manufacture a similar writing instrument in the U.S. Thus
        fortune smiled on the Biro brothers in May 1945, when the American company ‘Eversharp’ paid
        them $500,000 for the exclusive manufacturing and marketing rights of the Biro ballpoint for
        the North American market. Eversharp were slow to put their pen into production, however,
        and this delay ultimately cost them their competitive advantage.
    </p>
    <p><strong>F.</strong> Meanwhile, in June 1945 an American named Milton Reynolds stumbled upon
        the Biro pen while on vacation in Buenos Aires. Immediately seeing its commercial potential,
        he bought several pens and returned to Chicago, where he discovered that loud’s original
        1888 patent had long since expired. This meant that the ballpoint was now in the public
        domain, and he therefore wasted no time making a copy based on the Biro design. Establishing
        his pen company with just $26,000, Reynolds quickly set up a factory with 300 workers who
        began production on 6th October 1945, stamping out pens from precious scraps of aluminum
        that hadn’t been used during the war for military equipment or weapons. Just 23 days later,
        it was Reynolds’ ballpoint pen that caused the stampede at Gimbels Department Store.
        Following the ballpoint’s debut in New York City, Eversharp challenged Reynolds in the law
        courts, but lost the case because the Biro brothers had failed to secure a U.S. patent on
        their invention.

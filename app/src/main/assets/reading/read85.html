    </p>
    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>An examination of the functioning of the senses in
        cetaceans, the</strong><br>
        <strong>group of mammals comprising whales, dolphins and porpoises</strong>
    </p>
    <p>
    <center><img class="size-full wp-image-3387 aligncenter" src="85.1.jpg" alt="" width="auto">
    </center>
    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some of the senses that we and other terrestrial mammals
    take for granted are either reduced or absent in cetaceans or fail to function well in water.
    For example, it appears from their brain structure that toothed species are unable to smell.
    Baleen species, on the other hand, appear to have some related brain structures but it is not
    known whether these are functional. It has been speculated that, as the blowholes evolved and
    migrated to the top of the head, the neural pathways serving sense of smell may have been nearly
    all sacrificed. Similarly, although at least some cetaceans have taste buds, the nerves serving
    these have degenerated or are rudimentary.
</p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The sense of touch has sometimes been described as weak too, but
        this view is probably mistaken. Trainers of captive dolphins and small whales often remark
        on their animals’ responsiveness to being touched or rubbed, and both captive and
        freeranging cetacean individuals of all species (particularly adults and calves, or members
        of the same subgroup) appear to make frequent contact. This contact may help to maintain
        order within a group, and stroking or touching are part of the courtship ritual in most
        species. The area around the blowhole is also particularly sensitive and captive animals
        often object strongly to being touched there.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The sense of vision is developed to different degrees in
        different species. Baleen species studied at close quarters underwater – specifically a grey
        whale calf in captivity for a year, and free-ranging right whales and humpback whales
        studied and filmed off Argentina and Hawaii – have obviously tracked objects with vision
        underwater, and they can apparently see moderately well both in water and in air. However,
        the position of the eyes so restricts the field of vision in baleen whales that they
        probably do not have stereoscopic vision.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">On the other hand, the position of the eyes in most dolphins and
        porpoises suggests that they have stereoscopic vision forward and downward. Eye position in
        freshwater dolphins, which often swim on their side or upside down while feeding, suggests
        that what vision they have is stereoscopic forward and upward. By comparison, the bottlenose
        dolphin has extremely keen vision in water. Judging from the way it watches and tracks
        airborne flying fish, it can apparently see fairly well through the air–water interface as
        well. And although preliminary experimental evidence suggests that their in-air vision is
        poor, the accuracy with which dolphins leap high to take small fish out of a trainer’s hand
        provides anecdotal evidence to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Such variation can no doubt be explained with reference to the
        habitats in which individual species have developed. For example, vision is obviously more
        useful to species inhabiting clear open waters than to those living in turbid rivers and
        flooded plains. The South American boutu and Chinese beiji, for instance, appear to have
        very limited vision, and the Indian susus are blind, their eyes reduced to slits that
        probably allow them to sense only the direction and intensity of light.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Although the senses of taste and smell appear to have
        deteriorated, and vision in water appears to be uncertain, such weaknesses are more than
        compensated for by cetaceans’ well-developed acoustic sense. Most species are highly vocal,
        although they vary in the range of sounds they produce, and many forage for food using
        echolocation. Large baleen whales primarily use the lower frequencies and are often limited
        in their repertoire. Notable exceptions are the nearly song-like choruses of bowhead whales
        in summer and the complex, haunting utterances of the humpback whales. Toothed species in
        general employ more of the frequency spectrum, and produce a wider variety of sounds, than
        baleen species (though the sperm whale apparently produces a monotonous series of
        high-energy clicks and little else). Some of the more complicated sounds are clearly
        communicative, although what role they may play in the social life and ‘culture’ of
        cetaceans has been more the subject of wild speculation than of solid science.

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="font-size: 10pt;"><strong><em>Can human beings communicate by thought alone? For more than a century the issue of telepathy has divided the scientific community, and even today it still sparks bitter controversy among top academics</em></strong></span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Since the 1970s, parapsychologists at leading universities and
        research institutes around the world have risked the derision of sceptical colleagues by
        putting the various claims for telepathy to the test in dozens of rigorous scientific
        studies. The results and their implications are dividing even the researchers who uncovered
        them.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Some researchers say the results constitute compelling evidence
        that telepathy is genuine. Other parapsychologists believe the field is on the brink of
        collapse, having tried to produce definitive scientific proof and failed. Sceptics and
        advocates alike do concur on one issue, however that the most impressive evidence so far has
        come from the so-called ‘ganzfeld’ experiments, a German term that means ‘whole field’.
        Reports of telepathic experiences had by people during meditation led parapsychologists to
        suspect that telepathy might involve ‘signals’ passing between people that were so faint
        that they were usually swamped by normal brain activity. In this case, such signals might be
        more easily detected by those experiencing meditation-like tranquillity in a relaxing ‘whole
        field’ of light, sound and warmth.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The ganzfeld experiment tries to recreate these conditions with
        participants sitting in soft reclining chairs in a sealed room, listening to relaxing sounds
        while their eyes are covered with special filters letting in only soft pink light. In early
        ganzfeld experiments, the telepathy test involved identification of a picture chosen from a
        random selection of four taken from a large image bank. The idea was that a person acting as
        a ‘sender’ would attempt to beam the image over to the ‘receiver’ relaxing in the sealed
        room. Once the session was over, this person was asked to identify which of the four images
        had been used. Random guessing would give a hit-rate of 25 per cent; if telepathy is real,
        however, the hit-rate would be higher. In 1982, the results from the first ganzfeld studies
        were analysed by one of its pioneers, the American parapsychologist Charles Honorton. They
        pointed to typical hit-rates of better than 30 per cent — a small effect, but one which
        statistical tests suggested could not be put down to chance.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The implication was that the ganzfeld method had revealed real
        evidence for telepathy. But there was a crucial flaw in this argument — one routinely
        overlooked in more conventional areas of science. Just because chance had been ruled out as
        an explanation did not prove telepathy must exist; there were many other ways of getting
        positive results. These ranged from ‘sensory leakage’ — where clues about the pictures
        accidentally reach the receiver — to outright fraud. In response, the researchers issued a
        review of all the ganzfeld studies done up to 1985 to show that 80 per cent had found
        statistically significant evidence. However, they also agreed that there were still too many
        problems in the experiments which could lead to positive results, and they drew up a list
        demanding new standards for future research.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">After this, many researchers switched to autoganzfeld tests — an
        automated variant of the technique which used computers to perform many of the key tasks
        such as the random selection of images. By minimising human involvement, the idea was to
        minimise the risk of flawed results. In 1987, results from hundreds of autoganzfeld tests
        were studied by Honorton in a ‘meta-analysis’, a statistical technique for finding the
        overall results from a set of studies. Though less compelling than before, the outcome was
        still impressive.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Yet some parapsychologists remain disturbed by the lack of
        consistency between individual ganzfeld studies. Defenders of telepathy point out that
        demanding impressive evidence from every study ignores one basic statistical fact: it takes
        large samples to detect small effects. If, as current results suggest, telepathy produces
        hit-rates only marginally above the 25 per cent expected by chance, it’s unlikely to be
        detected by a typical ganzfeld study involving around 40 people: the group is just not big
        enough. Only when many studies are combined in a meta-analysis will the faint signal of
        telepathy really become apparent. And that is what researchers do seem to be finding.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What they are certainly not finding, however, is any change in
        attitude of mainstream scientists: most still totally reject the very idea of telepathy. The
        problem stems at least in part from the lack of any plausible mechanism for telepathy.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Various theories have been put forward, many focusing on
        esoteric ideas from theoretical physics. They include ‘quantum entanglement’, in which
        events affecting one group of atoms instantly affect another group, no matter how far apart
        they may be. While physicists have demonstrated entanglement with specially prepared atoms,
        no-one knows if it also exists between atoms making up human minds. Answering such questions
        would transform parapsychology. This has prompted some researchers to argue that the future
        lies not in collecting more evidence for telepathy, but in probing possible mechanisms. Some
        work has begun already, with researchers trying to identify people who are particularly
        successful in autoganzfeld trials. Early results show that creative and artistic people do
        much better than average: in one study at the University of Edinburgh, musicians achieved a
        hit-rate of 56 per cent. Perhaps more tests like these will eventually give the researchers
        the evidence they are seeking and strengthen the case for the existence of telepathy.

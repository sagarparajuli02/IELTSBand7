    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 18pt; color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Nature of Genius</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">There has always been an interest in geniuses and prodigies. The
        word ‘genius’, from the Latin gens (= family) and the term ‘genius’, meaning ‘begetter’,
        comes from the early Roman cult of a divinity as the head of the family. In its earliest
        form, genius was concerned with the ability of the head of the family, the paterfamilias, to
        perpetuate himself. Gradually, genius came to represent a person’s characteristics and
        thence an individual’s highest attributes derived from his ‘genius’ or guiding spirit.
        Today, people still look to stars or genes, astrology or genetics, in the hope of finding
        the source of exceptional abilities or personal characteristics.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The concept of genius and of gifts has become part of our folk
        culture, and attitudes are ambivalent towards them. We envy the gifted and mistrust them. In
        the mythology of giftedness, it is popularly believed that if people are talented in one
        area, they must be defective in another, that intellectuals are impractical, that prodigies
        burn too brightly too soon and burn out, that gifted people are eccentric, that they are
        physical weaklings, that there’s a thin line between genius and madness, that genius runs in
        families, that the gifted are so clever they don’t need special help, that giftedness is the
        same as having a high 10, that some races are more intelligent or musical or mathematical
        than others, that genius goes unrecognised and unrewarded, that adversity makes men wise or
        that people with gifts have a responsibility to use them. Language has been enriched with
        such terms as ‘highbrow’, ‘egghead’, ‘blue-stocking’, ‘wiseacre’, ‘know-all’, ‘boffin’ and,
        for many, ‘intellectual’ is a term of denigration.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The nineteenth century saw considerable interest in the nature
        of genius, and produced not a few studies of famous prodigies. Perhaps for us today, two of
        the most significant aspects of most of these studies of genius are the frequency with which
        early encouragement and teaching by parents and tutors had beneficial effects on the
        intellectual, artistic or musical development of the children but caused great difficulties
        of adjustment later in their lives, and the frequency with which abilities went unrecognised
        by teachers and schools. However, the difficulty with the evidence produced by these
        studies, fascinating as they are in collecting together anecdotes and apparent similarities
        and exceptions, is that they are not what we would today call norm-referenced. In other
        words, when, for instance, information is collated about early illnesses, methods of
        upbringing, schooling, etc., we must also take into account information from other
        historical sources about how common or exceptional these were at the time. For instance,
        infant mortality was high and life expectancy much shorter than today, home tutoring was
        common in the families of the nobility and wealthy, bullying and corporal punishment were
        common at the best independent schools and, for the most part, the cases studied were
        members of the privileged classes. It was only with the growth of paediatrics and psychology
        in the twentieth century that studies could be carried out on a more objective, if still not
        always very scientific, basis.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Geniuses, however they are defined, are but the peaks which
        stand out through the mist of history and are visible to the particular observer from his or
        her particular vantage point. Change the observers and the vantage points, clear away some
        of the mist, and a different lot of peaks appear. Genius is a term we apply to those whom we
        recognise for their outstanding achievements and who stand near the end of the continuum of
        human abilities which reaches back through the mundane and mediocre to the incapable. There
        is still much truth in Dr Samuel Johnson’s observation, The true genius is a mind of large
        general powers, accidentally determined to some particular direction’. We may disagree with
        the ‘general’, for we doubt if all musicians of genius could have become scientists of
        genius or vice versa, but there is no doubting the accidental determination which nurtured
        or triggered their gifts into those channels into which they have poured their powers so
        successfully. Along the continuum of abilities are hundreds of thousands of gifted men and
        women, boys and girls.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">What we appreciate, enjoy or marvel at in the works of genius or
        the achievements of prodigies are the manifestations of skills or abilities which are
        similar to, but so much superior to, our own. But that their minds are not different from
        our own is demonstrated by the fact that the hard-won discoveries of scientists like Kepler
        or Einstein become the commonplace knowledge of schoolchildren and the once outrageous
        shapes and colours of an artist like Paul Klee so soon appear on the fabrics we wear. This
        does not minimise the supremacy of their achievements, which outstrip our own as the
        sub-four-minute milers outstrip our jogging.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">To think of geniuses and the gifted as having uniquely different
        brains is only reasonable if we accept that each human brain is uniquely different. The
        purpose of instruction is to make us even more different from one another, and in the
        process of being educated we can learn from the achievements of those mom gifted than
        ourselves. But before we try to emulate geniuses or encourage our children to do so we
        should note that some of the things we learn from them may prove unpalatable. We may envy
        their achievements and fame, but we should also recognise the price they may have paid in
        terms of perseverance, single-mindedness, dedication, restrictions on their personal lives,
        the demands upon their energies and time, and how often they had to display great courage to
        preserve their integrity or to make their way to the top.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Genius and giftedness are relative descriptive terms of no real
        substance. We may, at best, give them some precision by defining them and placing them in a
        context but, whatever we do, we should never delude ourselves into believing that gifted
        children or geniuses are different from the rest of humanity, save in the degree to which
        they have developed the performance of their abilities.

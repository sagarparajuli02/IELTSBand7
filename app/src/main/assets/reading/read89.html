<p style="text-align: center;"><span
        style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;"><strong>Ancient Egypt</strong></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The people of ancient Egypt emerged as one of the first Western
    civilisations. Sustained by the River Nile and protected by vast deserts, the Egyptians lived in
    comparative security, prosperity and peace far thousands of years. When such conditions exist,
    the civilisation and its arts usually flourish. To this day, many of the Egyptian artistic
    creations display the wealth, splendour and talent of this great civilisation.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Ancient Egypt has been called a land of temples and tombs, and for
    centuries people have been filled with wonder at the ingenuity of the Egyptians, whose
    impressive works have withstood the ravages of time so well. Had it not been for the
    long-lasting nature of their monuments and carved inscriptions in the form of hieroglyphics’,
    much evidence of their activities would have vanished from ail historical records. In about 3000
    BC, Upper and Lower Egypt were united under the first pharaoh, and generally from that time
    until the invasion by Alexander the Great in 332 BC, Egypt prospered as a nation of skilful
    craftsmen and artists.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Egyptians were an industrious, highly civilised and deeply
    religious people, who obediently accepted the supreme authority of their pharaohs. The people
    were content to serve and work for the state in return for a secure livelihood. They considered
    this earthly life to be a segment in a great cycle, at the end of which everything would be
    returned to its original form. The richer and more important the person, the more careful and
    elaborate would be his or her burial, and the stronger and safer the tomb in which they would be
    buried.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The burial of the dead in the ground was not considered sufficiently
    safe for kings, queens and court officials, so sunken, sealed tombs were ingeniously constructed
    to protect personal treasures, food and instructions for the safe conduct of the soul after
    death. The design of these tombs developed into the stepped pyramid, and finally into the square
    pyramid that we know today.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">There are about 80 ancient pyramids in Egypt. The Great Pyramid at
    Gizeh, which King Cheops built as his tomb 5000 years ago, holds most interest. It stands with
    two other pyramids on a slight rise overlooking the River Nile. At the centre of the pyramid is
    the King’s Chamber and leading down from there is a long narrow area known as the Grand Gallery.
    The pyramid covers 13 acres and contains 2,300,000 blocks of limestone, each weighing an average
    of 1.5 tons. Its pyramidal form has a perfectly square base with sides of 756 feet and a height
    of 481 feet. Situated directly below the King’s Chamber is the Queen’s Chamber and there are two
    air channels leading upwards from the centre of the pyramid to the outside.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Originally the exterior was covered in highly polished limestone
    slabs, all of which have been stolen over the years. It is estimated that a total of 100,000 men
    laboured for 20 years to build this gigantic structure, and although architecturally unimportant
    in design, it has aroused the curiosity of millions of people because of the uncanny accuracy of
    its measurements and proportions. It reveals the remarkable ingenuity and the great organising
    ability of the ancient Egyptians.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Near these pyramids stands the Great Sphinx, the origin and purpose
    of which constitute one of the world’s most famous puzzles. Shaped from an outcrop of stone in
    the form of a human-headed lion, the face is possibly a portrait of King Khafra, the son of
    Cheops, who was buried in the second largest pyramid. The Sphinx is one of the biggest statues
    ever made.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The Egyptian people showed reverence towards natural objects such as
    the lotus flower, the scarab beetle, the falcon, the lion, the sun and the River Nile. AII these
    subjects and many more were used symbolically and conventionally as motifs in low-relief carving
    and painting. It was the custom of the Egyptians to depict the various parts of the human
    figure, usually in the most characteristic positions. The head was shown in profile except for
    the eye, which was represented from the front, the shoulders and a portion of the arms wert
    portrayed from the front, while the hips and legs were side views. Wall decoration showed little
    or no attempt to indicate depth or perspective, except by placing distant objects above near
    things. It was essentially two-dimensional, and relative size indicated the status of the
    person, so the pharaoh was the largest figure in the composition.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Egyptian art is characterised by a passion for permanence, a desire
    to impress by size, and a determination to make each item serve its function without much regard
    for the whole. It is obvious that art among these people reached a very high level and the
    strong influence of Egyptian art can be seen in the work of nearby civilisations.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The fortunate discovery and subsequent deciphering in 1822 of the
    Rosetta Stone, which showed the same laws inscribed both in Egyptian hieroglyphics and the
    Egyptian demotic, or popular version of their language, as well as the Greek language,
    eventually gave the key to the meaning of Egyptian inscriptions, and therefore the significance
    of much Egyptian art.

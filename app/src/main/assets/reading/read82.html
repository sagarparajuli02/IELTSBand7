    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;"><strong>The Impact of Wilderness Tourism</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;A.&nbsp;</strong>The market for tourism in remote
        areas is booming as never before. Countries all across the world are actively promoting
        their ‘wilderness’ regions – such as mountains, Arctic lands, deserts, small islands and
        wetlands – to high-spending tourists. The attraction of these areas is obvious: by
        definition, wilderness tourism requires little or no initial investment. But that does not
        mean that there is no cost. As the 1992 United Nations Conference on Environment and
        Development recognized, these regions are fragile (i.e. highly vulnerable to abnormal
        pressures) not just in terms of their ecology, but also in terms of the culture of their
        inhabitants. The three most significant types of fragile environment in these respects, and
        also in terms of the proportion of the Earth’s surface they cover, are deserts, mountains
        and Arctic areas. An important characteristic is their marked seasonality, with harsh
        conditions prevailing for many months each year. Consequently, most human activities,
        including tourism, are limited to quite clearly defined parts of the year. Tourists are
        drawn to these regions by their natural landscape beauty and the unique cultures of their
        indigenous people. And poor governments in these isolated areas have welcomed the new breed
        of ‘adventure tourist’, grateful for the hard currency they bring. For several years now,
        tourism has been the prime source of foreign exchange in Nepal and Bhutan. Tourism is also a
        key element in the economies of Arctic zones such as Lapland and Alaska and in desert areas
        such as Ayers Rock in Australia and Arizona’s Monument Valley.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B.&nbsp;</strong>Once a location is established as a
        main tourist destination, the effects on the local community are profound. When
        hill-farmers, for example, can make more money in a few weeks working as porters for foreign
        trekkers than they can in a year working in their fields, it is not surprising that many of
        them give up their farm-work, which is thus left to other members of the family. In some
        hill-regions, this has led to a serious decline in farm output and a change in the local
        diet, because there is insufficient labour to maintain terraces and irrigation systems and
        tend to crops. The result has been that many people in these regions have turned to outside
        supplies of rice and other foods.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">In Arctic and desert societies, year-round survival has
        traditionally depended on hunting animals and fish and collecting fruit over a relatively
        short season. However, as some inhabitants become involved in tourism, they no longer have
        time to collect wild food; this has led to increasing dependence on bought food and stores.
        Tourism is not always the culprit behind such changes. All kinds of wage labour, or
        government handouts, tend to undermine traditional survival systems. Whatever the cause, the
        dilemma is always the same: what happens if these new, external sources of income dry up?
        The physical impact of visitors is another serious problem associated with the growth in
        adventure tourism. Much attention has focused on erosion along major trails, but perhaps
        more important are the deforestation and impacts on water supplies arising from the need to
        provide tourists with cooked food and hot showers. In both mountains and deserts,
        slow-growing trees are often the main sources of fuel and water supplies may be limited or
        vulnerable to degradation through heavy use.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C.&nbsp;</strong>Stories about the problems of tourism
        have become legion in the last few years. Yet it does not have to be a problem. Although
        tourism inevitably affects the region in which it takes place, the costs to these fragile
        environments and their local cultures can be minimized. Indeed, it can even be a vehicle for
        reinvigorating local cultures, as has happened with the Sherpas of Nepal’s Khumbu Valley and
        in some Alpine villages. And a growing number of adventure tourism operators are trying to
        ensure that their activities benefit the local population and environment over the long
        term. In the Swiss Alps, communities have decided that their future depends on integrating
        tourism more effectively with the local economy. Local concern about the rising number of
        second home developments in the Swiss Pays d’Enhaut resulted in limits being imposed on
        their growth. There has also been a renaissance in communal cheese production in the area,
        providing the locals with a reliable source of income that does not depend on outside
        visitors. Many of the Arctic tourist destinations have been exploited by outside companies,
        who employ transient workers and repatriate most of the profits to their home base. But some
        Arctic communities are now operating tour businesses themselves, thereby ensuring that the
        benefits accrue locally. For instance, a native corporation in Alaska, employing local
        people, is running an air tour from Anchorage to Kotzebue, where tourists eat Arctic food,
        walk on the tundra and watch local musicians and dancers. Native people in the desert
        regions of the American Southwest have followed similar strategies, encouraging tourists to
        visit their pueblos and reservations to purchase high-quality handicrafts and artwork. The
        Acoma and San Ildefonso pueblos have established highly profitable pottery businesses, while
        the Navajo and Hopi groups have been similarly successful with jewellery. Too many people
        living in fragile environments have lost control over their economies, their culture and
        their environment when tourism has penetrated their homelands. Merely restricting tourism
        cannot be the solution to the imbalance, because people’s desire to see new places will not
        just disappear. Instead, communities in fragile environments must achieve greater control
        over tourism ventures in their regions; in order to balance their needs and aspirations with
        the demands of tourism. A growing number of communities are demonstrating that, with firm
        communal decision-making, this is possible. The critical question now is whether this can
        become the norm, rather than the exception.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;"><strong>Flawed Beauty: the problem with toughened glass</strong></span>
    </p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;">On 2nd August 199.9, a particularly hot day in the town of
        Cirencester in the UK, a large pane of toughened glass in the roof of a shopping centre at
        Bishops Walk shattered without warning and fell from its frame. When fragments were analysed
        by experts at the giant glass manufacturer Pilkington, which had made the pane, they found
        that minute crystals of nickel sulphide trapped inside the glass had almost certainly caused
        the failure.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">‘The glass industry is aware of the issue,’ says Brian Waldron,
        chairman of the standards committee at the Glass and Glazing Federation, a British trade
        association, and standards development officer at Pilkington. But he insists that cases are
        few and far between. ‘It’s a very rare phenomenon,’ he says.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Others disagree. ‘On average I see about one or two buildings a
        month suffering from nickel sulphide related failures,’ says Barrie Josie, a consultant
        engineer involved in the Bishops Walk investigation. Other experts tell of similar
        experiences. Tony Wilmott of London-based consulting engineers Sandberg, and Simon Armstrong
        at CIadTech Associates in Hampshire both say they know of hundreds of cases. ‘What you hear
        is only the tip of the iceberg,’ says Trevor Ford, a glass expert at Resolve Engineering in
        Brisbane, Queensland. He believes the reason is simple: ‘No-one wants bad press.’
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Toughened glass is found everywhere, from cars and bus shelters
        to the windows, walls and roofs of thousands of buildings around the world. It’s easy to see
        why. This glass has five times the strength of standard glass, and when it does break it
        shatters into tiny cubes rather than large, razor-sharp shards. Architects love it because
        large panels can be bolted together to make transparent walls, and turning it into ceilings
        and floors is almost as easy.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">It is made by heating a sheet of ordinary glass to about 620°C
        to soften it slightly, allowing its structure to expand, and then cooling it rapidly with
        jets of cold air. This causes the outer layer of the pane to contract and solidify before
        the interior. When the interior finally solidifies and shrinks, it exerts a pull on the
        outer layer that leaves it in permanent compression and produces a tensile force inside the
        glass. As cracks propagate best in materials under tension, the compressive force on the
        surface must be overcome before the pane will break, making it more resistant to cracking.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The problem starts when glass contains nickel sulphide
        impurities. Trace amounts of nickel and sulphur are usually present in the raw materials
        used to make glass, and nickel can also be introduced by fragments of nickel alloys falling
        into the molten glass. As the glass is heated, these atoms react to form tiny crystals of
        nickel sulphide. Just a tenth of a gram of nickel in the furnace can create up to 50,000
        crystals.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">These crystals can exist in two forms: a dense form called the
        alpha phase, which is stable at high temperatures, and a less dense form called the beta
        phase, which is stable at room temperatures. The high temperatures used in the toughening
        process convert all the crystals to the dense, compact alpha form. But the subsequent
        cooling is so rapid that the crystals don’t have time to change back to the beta phase. This
        leaves unstable alpha crystals in the glass, primed like a coiled spring, ready to revert to
        the beta phase without warning.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">When this happens, the crystals expand by up to 4%. And if they
        are within the central, tensile region of the pane, the stresses this unleashes can shatter
        the whole sheet. The time that elapses before failure occurs is unpredictable. It could
        happen just months after manufacture, or decades later, although if the glass is heated – by
        sunlight, for example – the process is speeded up. Ironically, says Graham Dodd, of
        consulting engineers Arup in London, the oldest pane of toughened glass known to have failed
        due to nickel sulphide inclusions was in Pilkington’s glass research building in Lathom,
        Lancashire. The pane was 27 years old.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Data showing the scale of the nickel sulphide problem is almost
        impossible to find. The picture is made more complicated by the fact that these crystals
        occur in batches. So even if, on average, there is only one inclusion in 7 tonnes of glass,
        if i you experience one nickel sulphide failure in your building, that probably means you’ve
        got a problem in more than one pane. Josie says that in the last decade he has worked on
        over 15 buildings with the number of failures into double figures.

    <p style="text-align: justify;">One of the worst examples of this is Waterfront Place, which was
        completed in 1990. Over the following decade the 40 storey Brisbane block suffered a rash of
        failures. Eighty panes of its toughened glass shattered due to inclusions before experts
        were finally called in. John Barry, an expert in nickel sulphide contamination at the
        University of Queensland, analysed every glass pane in the building. Using a studio camera,
        a photographer went up in a cradle to take photos of every pane.<br>
        These were scanned under a modified microfiche reader for signs of niclrel sulphide
        crystals. ‘We discovered at least another 120 panes with potentially dangerous inclusions
        which were then replaced,’ says Barry. ‘It was a very expensive and time-consuming process
        that took around six months to complete.’ Though the project cost A$1.6 million (nearly
        £700,000), the alternative – re-cladding the entire building – would have cost ten times as
        much.

    <p><strong>Toughened Glass</strong>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Toughened glass is favoured by architects because it is much
        stronger than ordinary glass, and the fragments are not as <strong>18</strong> ……………….. when
        it breaks. However, it has one disadvantage: it can shatter&nbsp;<strong>19&nbsp;</strong>……………………
        This fault is a result of the manufacturing process. Ordinary glass is first heated, then
        cooled very&nbsp;<strong>20&nbsp;</strong>………………….. .<br>
        The outer layer&nbsp;<strong>21</strong>&nbsp;………………….. before the inner layer, and the
        tension between the two layers which is created because of this makes the glass stronger.
        However, if the glass contains nickel sulphide impurities, crystals of nickel sulphide are
        formed. These are unstable, and can expand suddenly, particularly&nbsp;if the weather is
        <strong>22</strong> …………………… If this happens, the pane of glass may break. The frequency
        with which such problems occur is <strong>23</strong> ………………….. by glass experts.
        Furthermore, the crystals cannot be detected without sophisticated equipment.

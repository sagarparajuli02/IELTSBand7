    <p style="text-align: center;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; color: #ff0000;"><strong>The effects of light on plant and animal species</strong></span>
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Light is important to organisms for two different reasons.
        Firstly it is used as a cue for the timing of daily and seasonal rhythms in both plane and
        animals, and secondly it is used to assist growth in plants.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Breeding in most organisms occurs during a part. of the year
        only, and so a reliable cue is needed to trigger breeding behaviour. Day length is an
        excellent cue, because it provides a perfectly predictable pattern of change within the
        year. In the temperate zone in spring, temperatures fluctuate greatly from day to day, but
        day length increases steadily by a predictable amount. The seasonal impact of day length on
        physiological responses is called photoperiodism, and the amount of experimental evidence
        for this phenomenon is considerable. For example, some species of birds’ breeding can be
        induced even in midwinter simply by increasing day length artificially (Wolfson 1964). Other
        examples of photoperiodism occur in plants. A short-day plant flowers when the day is less
        than a certain critical length. A long-day plant flowers after a certain critical day length
        is exceeded. In both cases the critical day length differs from species to species. Plane
        which flower after a period of vegetative growth, regardless of photoperiod, are known as
        day-neutral plants.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Breeding seasons in animals such as birds have evolved to occupy
        the part of the year in which offspring have the greatest chances of survival. Before the
        breeding season begins, food reserves must be built up to support the energy cost of
        reproduction, and to provide for young birds both when they are in the nest and after
        fledging. Thus many temperate-zone birds use the increasing day lengths in spring as a cue
        to begin the nesting cycle, because this is a point when adequate food resources will be
        assured.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The adaptive significance of photoperiodism in plane is also
        clear. Short-day plane that flower in spring in the temperate zone are adapted to maximising
        seedling growth during the growing season. Long-day plants are adapted for situations that
        require fertilization by insects, or a long period of seed ripening. Short-day plane that
        flower in the autumn in the temperate zone are able to build up food reserves over the
        growing season and over winter as seeds. Day-neutral plane have an evolutionary advantage
        when the connection between the favourable period for reproduction and day length is much
        less certain. For example, desert annuals germinate, flower and seed whenever suitable
        rainfall occurs, regardless of the day length.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The breeding season of some plants can be delayed to
        extraordinary lengths. Bamboos are perennial grasses that remain in a vegetative state for
        many years and then suddenly flower, fruit and die (Evans 1976). Every bamboo of the species
        Chusquea abietifolio on the island<br>
        of Jamaica flowered, set seed and died during 1884. The next generation of bamboo flowered
        and died between 1916 and 1918, which suggests a vegetative cycle of about 31 years. The
        climatic trigger for this flowering cycle is not-yet known, but the adaptive significance is
        clear. The simultaneous production of masses of bamboo seeds (in some cases lying I2 to I5
        centimetres deep on the ground) is more than all the seed-eating animals can cope with at
        the time, so that some seeds escape being eaten and grow up to form the next generation
        (Evans 1976).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">The second reason light is important to organisms is that it is
        essential for photosynthesis. This is the process by which plants use energy from the sun to
        convert carbon from soil or water into organic material for growth. The rate of
        photosynthesis in a plant can be measured by calculating the rate of its uptake of carbon.
        There is a wide range of photosynthetic responses of plants to variations in light
        intensity. Some plants reach maximal photosynthesis at one-quarter full sunlight, and
        others, like sugarcane, never reach a maximum, but continue to increase photosynthesis rate
        as light intensity rises.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">Plants in general can be divided into two groups: shade-tolerant
        species and shade-intolerant species. This classification is commonly used in forestry and
        horticulture. Shade-tolerant plane have lower photosynthetic rates and hence have lower
        growth rates than those of shade-intolerant species. Plant species become adapted to living
        in a certain kind of habitat, and in the process evolve a series of characteristics that
        prevent them from occupying other habitats. Grime ( 1966) suggests that light may be one of
        the major components directing these adaptations. For example, eastern hemlock seedlings are
        shade-tolerant. They can survive in the forest understorey under very low light levels
        because they have a low photosynthetic rate.

    <p style="text-align: center;"><strong>HOW DOES THE BIOLOGICAL CLOCK TICK?</strong></p>

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>A.</strong>&nbsp;Our life span is restricted. Everyone
        accepts this as ‘biologically’ obvious. ‘Nothing lives for ever!’ However, in this statement
        we think of artificially produced, technical objects, products which are subjected to
        natural wear and tear during use. This leads to the result that at some time or other the
        object stops working and is unusable (‘death’ in the biological sense). But are the wear and
        tear and loss of function of technical objects and the death of living organisms really
        similar or comparable.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>B.</strong>&nbsp;Our ‘dead’ products are ‘static’,
        closed systems. It is always the basic material which constitutes the object and which, in
        the natural course of things, is wom down and becomes ‘older’. Ageing in this case must
        occur according to the laws of physical chemistry and of thermodynamics. Although the same
        law holds for a living organism, the result of this law is not inexorable in the same way.
        At least as long as a biological system has the ability to renew itself it could actually
        become older without ageing; an organism is an open, dynamic system through which new
        material continuously flows. Destruction of old material and formation of new material are
        thus in permanent dynamic equilibrium. The material of which the organism is formed changes
        continuously. Thus our bodies continuously exchange old substance for new, just like a
        spring which more or less maintains its form and movement, but in which the water molecules
        are always different.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>C.</strong>&nbsp;Thus ageing and death should not be
        seen as inevitable, particularly as the organism possesses many mechanisms for repair. It is
        not, in principle, necessary for a biological system to age and die. Nevertheless, a
        restricted life span, ageing, and then death are basic characteristics of life. The reason
        for this is easy to recognise: in nature, the existent organisms either adapt or are
        regularly replaced by new types. Because of changes in the genetic material (mutations)
        these have new characteristics and in the course of their individual lives they are tested
        for optimal or better adaptation to the environmental conditions. Immortality would disturb
        this system — it needs room for new and better life. This is the basic problem of evolution.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>D.</strong>&nbsp;Every organism has a life span which is
        highly characteristic. There are striking differences in life span between different
        species, but within one species the parameter is relatively constant. For example, the
        average duration of human life has hardly changed in thousands of years. Although more and
        more people attain an advanced age as a result of developments in medical care and better
        nutrition, the characteristic upper limit for most remains 80 years. A further argument
        against the simple wear and tear theory is the observation that the time within which
        organisms age lies between a few days (even a few hours for unicellular organisms) and
        several thousand years, as with mammoth trees.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>E.</strong>&nbsp;If a life span is a genetically
        determined biological characteristic, it is logically necessary to propose the existence of
        an internal clock, which in some way measures and controls the ageing process and which
        finally determines death as the last step in a fixed programme. Like the life span, the
        metabolic rate has for different organisms a fixed mathematical relationship to the body
        mass. In comparison to the life span this relationship is ‘inverted’: the larger the
        organism the lower its metabolic rate. Again this relationship is valid not only for birds,
        but also, similarly on average within the systematic unit, for all other organisms (plants,
        animals, unicellular organisms).
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>F.</strong>&nbsp;Animals which behave ‘frugally’ with
        energy become particularly old, for example, crocodiles and tortoises. Parrots and birds of
        prey are often held chained up. Thus they are not able to ‘experience life’ and so they
        attain a high life span in captivity. Animals which save energy by hibernation or lethargy
        (e.g. bats or hedgehogs) live much longer than those which are always active. The metabolic
        rate of mice can be reduced by a very low consumption of food (hunger diet). They then may
        live twice as long as their well fed comrades. Women become distinctly (about 10 per cent)
        older than men. If you examine the metabolic rates of the two sexes you establish that the
        higher male metabolic rate roughly accounts for the lower male life span. That means that
        they live life ‘energetically’ — more intensively, but not for as long.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>G.</strong>&nbsp;It follows from the above that sparing
        use of energy reserves should tend to extend life. Extreme high performance sports may lead
        to optimal cardiovascular performance, but they quite certainly do not prolong life.
        Relaxation lowers metabolic rate, as does adequate sleep and in general an equable and
        balanced personality. Each of as can develop his or her own ‘energy saving programme’ with a
        little self-observation, critical self-control and, above all, logical consistency.
        Experience will show that to live in this way not only increases the life span but is also
        very healthy. This final aspect should not be forgotten.

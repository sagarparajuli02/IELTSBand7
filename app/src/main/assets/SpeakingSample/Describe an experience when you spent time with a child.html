</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, I’d like to tell you about an experience when I spent time with a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>kid</strong></span>. It was when I was about 15 years old and I had to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>look after</strong></span> my brother’s 2 year old son, who is my nephew. It was on a weekend one time when I was visiting my brother and his wife and their son. My brother’s wife was at work that day and he had to go out to the shops to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>pick-up</strong></span> some <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>groceries</strong></span> to cook for dinner, but instead of all of us go together, he decided that it would be much more <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>convenient</strong> </span>if he went alone and I stayed at home to look after my nephew while he was gone. At first I was a bit <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>shocked</strong> </span>that he came up with this idea because I had never looked after a small child on my own before and I was a bit nervous and didn’t know what to do or what to expect, especially if something went wrong. But my brother <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">reassured</span> </strong>me that he would only be gone for about 30 minutes or so and that everything would be fine, and if I needed to contact him in an emergency then I should just call him on his mobile phone. So I <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">reluctantly</span> </strong>agreed.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, so my brother went off to the supermarket and I stayed at home with my nephew. At first I think I just put on one of his favourite cartoons on the TV to try and keep him <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>occupied</strong> </span>for a while, but this only worked <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>for so long</strong></span>. After around 15 minutes, he got bored of that and wanted to do something else, so I then went and got all of his toys from his bedroom and brought them out into the lounge room and tipped them on the floor. We then made a big mess playing with his toys for about 10 mins before he quickly became bored again. So then after that I went to the kitchen and found some of his favourite snacks and we sat back down to watch cartoons again on the television and eat the snacks. After about 5 minutes though, thankfully he fell asleep until my brother arrived home. So, all in all, it was a fine experience I guess. I was quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>relieved</strong> </span>that nothing bad happened and I realized that it wasn’t that difficult to look after small kids.

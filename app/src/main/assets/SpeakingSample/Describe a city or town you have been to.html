</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I’d like to talk about Singapore, one of several cities I have visited and really enjoyed. I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>vacationed</strong></span> in this wonderful city last summer with my sister, Min, and we stayed there for 5 days.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Singapore is a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>state-city </strong></span>located to the southeast of Vietnam and it took us only 2 hours to fly there from Hanoi.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">When I arrived in Singapore, I was quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>impressed by</strong></span> the way the city looked. The streets were <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>incredibly</strong></span> clean, I could walk around the city all day and come back home without any dirt on my shoes. During my stay in Singapore, I did some shopping and visited some <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>famous landmarks</strong></span> like the Merlion statue, Singapore <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>zoo</strong></span> and the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>botanical gardens</strong>.</span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">For me, Singapore is <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>well worth visiting</strong></span> for many reasons. Firstly, the public transport system in Singapore is extremely reliable. People don’t have to spend hours waiting for buses or trains, and the staff are very friendly and helpful. Another thing that I miss about Singapore is its <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>multi-cultural nature</strong></span>. During the 5 days that I spent in Singapore, I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>bumped into</strong></span> people from many different countries. English is the first language of this country so it was great to get the chance to practice my English-speaking skills with the local people and also other tourists. Five days in Singapore passed by so fast that I wish I could’ve stayed a bit longer.

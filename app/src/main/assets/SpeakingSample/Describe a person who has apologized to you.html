<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well I think that we all tend to make some mistakes in life now and then, sometimes <strong>intentionally</strong>, and sometimes unintentionally, but we usually regret them afterwards. I always try to apologize for what I do wrong, and of course, I expect the same from others.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So last month, my friend borrowed my car for the day and he knows very well that I’m very <strong>possessive</strong> about my car. I asked him to take good care of it as I know he is not a very good driver, and in fact, this is the reason why his father doesn’t buy him his own car.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But he promised me to drive it very <strong>cautiously</strong> and safely, however when he returned it in the evening he sounded very low and he told me that someone hit the car from the rear when he was stuck in a traffic-jam and that caused him to hit the car in front of him. He was feeling very guilty for not taking care of the car and he apologized repeatedly for his <strong>negligence</strong>, and he assured me that he would get it repaired the first thing the next morning.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I did feel sorry for him though, but at the same time very sad as my car was damaged, but somewhere in my mind I knew that this was not his fault. Normally, I easily <strong>lose my temper</strong> but it was because of his <strong>sincere </strong>apology that I couldn’t stay mad at him for very long.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So the next day, he went with me to the mechanic and luckily the damage was not so bad or expensive to fix. He apologized again and assured me that he’d be more <strong>vigilant</strong> in the future. We are still good friends and I feel that receiving an apology and forgiving someone is the best way to maintain and make relationships stronger.</p>

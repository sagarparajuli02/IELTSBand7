<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BAND 8 Sample </strong></span>
</p><p>Well, the person I’d like to talk to you about is a very good friend of mine, Mai. She must be one of the nicest and most polite individuals I know.
</p><p>We’ve basically known each other <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>since forever</strong></span> because we were in the same class from high school through to college. She is like <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>my partner in crime</strong></span> and we can share everything together from schoolwork to our<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> love lives</strong></span>.
</p><p>You know, the first time I met her she left a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>deep impression</strong></span> on me because on the first day of school I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>got lost</strong></span> while trying to find my classroom and she really helped me out. Surprisingly, we were also arranged by the teacher to be <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>desk-mates</strong></span>.
</p><p>And the reason why I think she’s so polite is simply because she has really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>good manners.</strong></span> She <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>abuses</strong></span> the word “thank you” even <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>on</strong> <strong>the slightest occasion</strong></span>. For instance, I’ve noticed that whenever we eat at a restaurant, she will thank the waiters whenever they bring a dish to the table. And another example would be that every time she gets off a bus, she will always say thank you to the driver, which a lot of people probably think isn’t necessary, but I’m sure the waiters and bus drivers really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>appreciate</strong></span> it. Finally, whenever our classmates ask her to help them with difficult homework, she never complains or shows any <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hesitation</strong></span>. And due to this, she always <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>maintains a good reputation</strong></span> thanks to her politeness.

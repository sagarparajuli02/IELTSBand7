<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I must say, I am extremely <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>fortunate</strong> </span>to have such a wonderful neighbour, Duy, who is really friendly and always willing to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>assist</strong> </span>me whenever I’m in trouble.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Duy and I live in the same building, and our apartments are next to each other. We came to know each other when the electricity to the entire building was <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>cut off</strong></span> one evening. Unfortunately, I had run out of candles and the torch was nowhere to be found, so I had to go to the apartment next door for help, and this was when I first met my neighbour. He was extremely helpful and enthusiastic and he asked me to hold his torch while he lit the candles in his apartment. I was really<strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"> grateful</span> </strong>for his help and a few days later, I made some snacks for him as a thank-you gift. Since then, we have become quite close friends.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The more I got to know Duy, the more I began to look up to him. Even though he is <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>well into his fifties</strong></span> and lives on his own, as he lost his family in a car accident, he still manages to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>see life through rose coloured glasses</strong></span>. His <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>motto</strong> </span>in life is “to keep moving forward”. He works and studies at the same time, and on the weekends, he travels to an <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>orphanage</strong> </span>to teach maths to the kids there.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">He really is a wonderful neighbour and I know I could<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"> <strong>call on</strong></span> him if I ever needed to. We will always help each other out when we can, and because we both live on our own, it’s really important to have a good friend close by.

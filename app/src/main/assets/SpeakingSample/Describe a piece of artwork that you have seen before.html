<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Band 8 Sample </strong></span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today I would like to tell you about one of the most well-known paintings in the world, which is also my personal favourite, the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>portrait</strong></span> of Mona Lisa.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">You know, the painting was created by Leonardo da Vinci, the famous Italian artist from the 15<sup>th</sup> century. When I first saw this painting in one of my high school textbooks, I just <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>couldn’t take my eyes off it</strong></span> due to some <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>mysterious attractiveness.</strong></span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>At first sight</strong>,</span> all I noticed in the painting was a long-haired woman with a friendly smile on her face, which was quite round, and she had no eyebrows either. The more I looked at it though, the more I felt like she was actually smiling at me.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Some people have claimed that Mona Lisa was simply an <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">imaginary</span> </strong>character while others have believed that she was actually Leonardo’s wife. Honestly, it doesn’t really matter to me though because I think that the Mona Lisa is a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>masterpiece</strong> </span>that attracts people with that magical smile. This is also one of the main reasons why I am a fan of the painting.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In terms of the actual truths behind this portrait though, I guess we may never know, but I think that secrets make everything all the more intriguing.

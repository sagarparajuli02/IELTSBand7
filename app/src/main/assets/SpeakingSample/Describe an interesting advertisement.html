<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So I’m going to talk about an advertisement for Blue Electronics, which is one of the&nbsp;biggest electronic brands in Vietnam. I’ve seen its advertisements everywhere, on TV commercials and even on social media networks like Facebook and Instagram.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The advertisement shows a video of people dressed as blue <strong>household appliances</strong>, smiling and staring <strong>creepily</strong> at the screen and dancing <strong>spontaneously</strong> to a really annoying yet <strong>catchy</strong> tune.</p>						
					
<p style="text-align: justify;">I think&nbsp;the aim of this ad is to create a big impression on the audience&nbsp;and&nbsp;to make the products seem more <strong>appealing</strong> to them. I also think they are trying to <strong>traumatize</strong> the audience so that whenever they hear that tune, they will think of Blue Electronics.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I think the advert is interesting because the company is&nbsp;<strong>deliberately</strong> trying to influence and attract&nbsp;people’s attention, and they do this by trying to present the household appliances as something special, and kind of like a useful friend for everyone I guess.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;I think older people will probably not enjoy these kinds of advertisements because older people usually prefer more informative, serious kind of ads, whereas the younger generation seems to be more crazy about this kind of advertisement, as I think they seem to be more open and able to <strong>perceive </strong>more<strong> innovative</strong> and <strong>hilarious</strong> ideas.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I have had many meals and taken part in many celebrations and parties over the years but among these, there’s one particular time that I remember the most. A few months ago, I went to a barbeque party on the rooftop of one of my friends’ homes. It was actually a <strong>farewell party</strong> for my best friend since she was going to study abroad, and the meal and the party were both really fantastic.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">We had been planning this party for a long time and so on the day, we gathered at my friend’s house and all went shopping and prepared everything together. We had a lot of amazing food that night as my best friend has a real <strong>talent for</strong> cooking. Thanks to her secret recipe, all the meat was <strong>marinated</strong> and <strong>seasoned</strong> perfectly and the taste was simply delicious. Besides the main dishes, a lot of drinks and snacks were served too. I myself enjoyed the dessert the most. It was a fluffy red velvet cake with a classic cream cheese <strong>frosting</strong>. We bought that from a famous bakery in Hanoi and it was <strong>worth every penny</strong>.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So we ate the grilled meat, drank beer and chatted the whole evening. During the dinner, we talked about our future, our funniest memories together and everybody had <strong>a real blast</strong>. There’s no doubt that it could be quite a long time until we can all gather like that again, so that party is very memorable to me.

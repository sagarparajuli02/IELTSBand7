<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Band 8 Sample</strong></span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the person I’d like to talk to you about is a very good friend of mine, Mai. She must be one of the nicest and most <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>down-to-earth </strong></span>individuals I know.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">If I were to describe how she looks I would say Mai is a very <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>gorgeous</strong> </span>and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>charming</strong> </span>girl who always attracts a lot of attention from men. She is much taller than me so it’s kind of embarrassing standing next to her to be honest. Mai also has straight brown hair and deep, dark brown eyes. Like most teenagers, she pays a lot of attention to her appearance and likes dressing in the latest and most <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>snazzy</strong> </span>fashion. I don’t think I’ve ever seen her in a plain old T- shirt or jeans.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, we’ve basically known each other <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>since forever</strong></span> because we were in the same class from high school through to college. You know, the first time I met her, she left a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>deep impression</strong></span> on me because on the first day at school, I got lost while trying to find my classroom and she was my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>saviour</strong></span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Coincidently</strong></span>, we were arranged by the teacher to become <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>desk-mates.</strong></span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And with regards to why she became my <strong>bestie</strong>, well, I guess the main reason is that we really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hit it off</strong></span> right from the start, and we also <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>see eye to eye</strong></span> on a lot of things such as fashion, sport and even video games. She is my closest friend so I feel like we can share everything together, from schoolwork to our <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>love lives</strong>.</span> The thing I admire most about Mai is that she is really protective and likes to look after people.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As a normal human being, however, Mai also has her <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>shortcomings</strong></span>. She’s never on time, and is sometimes quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>absent-minded</strong></span> and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>inconsiderate</strong> </span>and that makes people think she never takes things seriously. But I don’t think this is true. She has a strong sense of responsibility and I know that I can always rely on her. For me, friendship is the most important thing in the world and I am proud to say that I have such a loyal and helpful friend – she’s really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>one in a million</strong>.</span>

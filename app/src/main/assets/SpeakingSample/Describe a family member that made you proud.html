<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">There is no one else in this world I hold more respect for than my mother. She is my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>guardian</strong></span>, my friend and my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>role model</strong></span>.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">My mother is <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>well into her forties</strong></span> now, but she still manages to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>maintain a youthful appearance</strong></span>. In terms of her personality, she is an extremely compassionate, kind-hearted and attentive person who always takes care of her children. She is both a mother and a friend to me as she always gives me valuable advice and is always willing to be there for me during all of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>the ups and downs</strong></span> in my life. Although sometimes she <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>drives me crazy</strong></span>, because she’s such a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>perfectionist</strong></span>, I still hold a lot of pride and respect for her.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The reason that I am so proud of her is because she is such a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>strong-willed</strong></span> person. Ever since she was young, she had to learn to be independent as my grandparents were constantly busy and always <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>on the go</strong></span>. She had to take care of almost everything, her younger brother, household chores and herself. Such challenges shaped her into the strong woman that she is now. Her independence has also been strengthened through all the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hardship</strong> </span>she has dealt with in her life. When she reached her thirties, she decided that she wanted to run her own business, a clothing store. All the members in our family tried to <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">prevent</span> </strong>her from doing this since we all thought it was a bad idea because she would have to face a lot of competition from other nearby shops.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But through her determination and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>perseverance</strong> </span>she has managed to make a success out of her business and it really is something for us <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>to look up to</strong></span>, and I keep reminding myself every day to try to be as strong as my mother, a real-life “wonder woman.”

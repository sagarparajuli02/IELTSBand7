</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to talk about one of my favourite activities on the beach, swimming. You know, I live in Hai Phong, a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>coastal city </strong></span>with <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>golden beaches </strong></span>and the nearest seashore is just fifteen minutes from my house. So, in the summer, my friends and I often go there and swim in the cool water to avoid the hot weather.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Actually, swimming is a relatively easy sport. I learned how to swim when I was about 8 years old and it took me only a week to get familiar with a number of <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">swimming strokes</span>, </strong>like breaststroke, backstroke and butterfly. Before entering the water, I often <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>warm up </strong></span>and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>stretch my muscles and joints </strong></span>to avoid any <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>injuries</strong></span>, then put on my swimsuit and jump right in.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I really enjoy swimming on the beach because of a few reasons. Firstly, unlike other water sports such as diving or windsurfing, which require <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>costly </strong></span>equipment, swimming costs nothing. Secondly, swimming is extremely <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>beneficial </strong></span>to our health. It provides an <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>all-over body workout</strong></span>, as nearly all of our muscles are used during swimming. It also <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">builds endurance, muscle strength and cardiovascular fitness</span>. </strong>Lastly, going swimming is a good <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>means</strong> <strong>of</strong></span> recreation as it allows me to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>unwind</strong>, <strong>alleviate stress </strong></span>and have a great time with my friends.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Summer is coming so I’ll definitely make a plan to visit the beach soon. I intend to go to Nha Trang beach as it’s considered as one of the most magnificent beaches in the world.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I’m the type of person who never likes to <strong>rely on luck</strong>. I believe that everything can only be achieved through hard work and determination, and my final year in high school was one of the times that I <strong>spared no effort</strong> to achieve my goal.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">At that point, I was still a senior student and like all the other students, passing the University entrance exam to get into my dream University was my main goal. But for me, I felt that the pressure was even higher since I had chosen Hanoi Medical University – one of the top Universities in Vietnam. There are thousands of students taking part in that exam every year so it is highly competitive.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">In order to compete with the other candidates, every day I would spend hours in the library to read as many books as possible and to learn as much as I could. And even after school, I usually stayed up late to review everything I had learnt that day. It was a long process with a lot of hard work but I didn’t feel tired at all because becoming a doctor was one of my greatest <strong>desires</strong>. I was willing to put in a lot of hard work and effort for that dream and to not let anything stop me from achieving it.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So in the end, all the <strong>hard work paid off</strong>, and I passed the entrance exam with <strong>outstanding</strong> results and became a medical student. When I received the results, I was so happy that I <strong>burst into tears</strong>. All of my hard work for the year had helped me achieve one of my big goals in life so far.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to talk about a policy which the government put in place a long time ago, and I believe that has had a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>tremendously</strong> </span>positive effect on the daily life of Vietnamese people.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I don’t remember the exact official title of the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>regulation</strong></span>, but generally, it states that people must separate their <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>household waste</strong></span> into three groups: <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>organic</strong></span>, inorganic and recyclable materials, each of which has been assigned a different coloured bin. To effectively make this rule work, the government has had to install thousands of different coloured bins throughout the city’s public areas.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;In the past, <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>waste disposal</strong></span> was such a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>daunting task</strong></span> for the local government to deal with because most people had very little <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>environmental awareness</strong></span>, and they often just mixed their trash into one giant mess, dumping it into rivers, on the streets or in any public place they felt like. This became quite an <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>alarming situation</strong></span> in Vietnam for a number of years and had an extremely <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>detrimental impact</strong></span> on the environment, and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>not to mention</strong></span> the mess it was creating in many urban areas.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, by introducing this new law and by <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>effectively campaigning</strong></span> it, <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a clear shift</strong></span> has occurred in people’s daily lives, as now there is an effective and practical solution to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>get rid of</strong></span> everyday waste, and people’s awareness around this issue has now significantly increased over the years. I’m really quite happy with how this law has helped to solve the waste problem in my country, rather than only the ineffective talk about the problem that was happening beforehand.

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sample band 8</strong></span>
</p><p>I am going to talk about Mrs. Kim who is a lovely lady that I recently <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>befriended</strong></span>.
</p><p>I started <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>college life</strong></span> 3 months ago and on my first day of school I was unable to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>navigate my way to</strong></span> my new university where I was studying. Google Maps wasn’t really as helpful as I thought it would be and I couldn’t <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>figure out the way</strong></span> by asking the locals either. So, after many hours of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>wandering around</strong></span>, I finally <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>resorted to </strong></span>asking a lady who was selling noodles from a food cart near where I was standing. I asked the lady if she knew the way to the HCMC University of Education, and she just smiled and pointed at the large, five-story building across the road. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Turns out</strong></span> I was there <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">all along</span>! </strong>So, after thanking the lady, we had a little chat and I found out she also came from Ninh Thuan, which is my hometown! We immediately became good friends and now her food cart has become my favourite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>lunch spot </strong></span>whenever I’m at university.
</p><p>So I guess the main reason that Mrs. Kim and I have become good friends is basically because I think she’s a really sweet lady. As I’ve gotten to know her better I’ve realized that she’s had quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a tough life</strong></span>, yet she has managed to maintain a sweet and gentle personality that many other women who have been through struggles like her would have lost by now. I guess the other reason we get on so well is because we share the same hometown, and I tend <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>to get on well with</strong></span> people from my hometown. Sometimes I think the best friendships are made so unexpectedly.

</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I am going to tell you about a well-known physicist whose biography recently really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>caught my attention</strong></span>. He is <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a house-hold name</strong></span> around the world, Albert Einstein.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">He is recognized as the father of modern physics and he was the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>founder</strong> </span>of the Theory of Relativity, which became an essential, if not the most important, contribution to modern science. He was also awarded the Nobel Physics prize thanks to this discovery.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Besides knowing him due to his many achievements, I did <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>come across</strong></span> and read a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>biography</strong> </span>of him on the internet which really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>intrigued</strong></span> me and contained a lot of information that made me admire him a lot. His childhood was not as <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>carefree</strong> </span>as I initially thought and I was totally impressed by his <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>perseverance</strong> </span>and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>dedication</strong> </span>to science despite having communication problems at a very young age.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I love how Albert Einstein lived and worked with passion and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>enthusiasm</strong> </span>all his life, which, I feel is <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a shining example</strong></span> and a great inspiration for me to follow. Albert was <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hunted</strong> </span>by the Nazi’s for most of his adult life, yet he never <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>abandoned</strong> </span>his love for science and kept working even when he was running to protect himself.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So, in other words, he really inspired me to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>pursue</strong> </span>my goals and dreams with all I that I have, despite any difficulties that I may come across along the way.

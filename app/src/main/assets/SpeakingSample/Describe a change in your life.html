</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to talk about one of the greatest <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>transformations </strong></span>in my life. I used to weigh around 65 kilos and after about 6 months of continuous <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>dieting</strong></span> and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>working out</strong>,</span> I successfully lost 15 kilos.
</p>	
<p style="text-align: justify;">When I was a teenager, I mainly <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>subsisted on </strong></span>fast foods such as fried chicken, hamburgers or crisps. And with a number of high school exams I was often forced to stay up late and eat even more. As a result, I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>put on weight </strong></span>rapidly and one day, when I stepped on a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>scale</strong></span>, it read 65 kilos, and I knew that I had to start my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>weight- loss journey </strong></span>or I would become overweight.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After consulting my aunt, who worked as a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>nutritionist</strong>,</span> I understood that losing weight was all about diet and exercise. Firstly, I cleaned out my fridge of all my favourite unhealthy foods, and began cooking <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>homemade meals</strong></span>. I also drank at least 2 litres of water a day instead of soft drink. Secondly, I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>registered</strong> </span>at my local gym and started to workout at least three times a week. And as well as this, I started going to bed early at night and waking up at 5 am to go <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>biking</strong> </span>every morning.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">After 6 months of working out regularly and <strong>resisting </strong>junk food, my weight dropped to 50 kilos. However, it was not only about the weight loss, but also about the changes in my health. I felt stronger and happier than ever before. I rarely got sick and my skin also looked brighter. More importantly though, I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>regained my self-confidence. </strong></span>I used to run and hide from cameras, but now I am much more comfortable being photographed. And the best thing is that I am now able to finally wear my old dresses and skinny jeans.

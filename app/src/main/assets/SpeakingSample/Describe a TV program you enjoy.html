</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I would like to talk about “The Walking Dead”, which is an American television drama <strong>series</strong> that I have recently become<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> crazy about</strong></span>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">As you might not know, The Walking Dead is the most popular TV show <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>on air </strong></span>right now and everybody <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>across the globe </strong></span>watches it. It <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>portrays</strong></span> the world after a zombie <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>apocalypse</strong></span>, where society has <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>crumbled</strong></span> and there is no government to take care of the people’s <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>welfare</strong>.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The show stars many talented and famous actors and actresses. Among them, I believe Andrew Lincoln, who plays the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>leading role </strong></span>of a police officer, leaves the most significant impression on <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>audiences</strong></span> and myself, mainly because of his outstanding acting skills and the devotion he put into every scene.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly enough, my favourite part about this show is the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>make-up </strong></span>of all the different zombies. You know, all the characters are well-designed and have to go through an<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"> <strong>elaborate</strong></span> makeup process to achieve extremely realistic looks on screen.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">And the reason why I am a huge fan of The Walking Dead? Well, it is quite easy to explain. I’ve held a great interest in Zombie apocalypse’s ever since I was a kid and I even dreamt about living in one. Apart from that, I think that this series has a very <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>stimulating</strong> <strong>plot </strong></span>along with many <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>unexpected twists</strong></span>, which raises great excitement for the viewers.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I just simply cannot get enough of this show and I can’t wait for the beginning of the next season.

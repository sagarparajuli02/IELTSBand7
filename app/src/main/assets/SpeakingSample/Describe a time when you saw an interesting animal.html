</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I’m going to talk about an occasion on which I got to see a group of small monkeys. As we all know, monkeys are one of the funniest animals in nature. They are full of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>curiosity</strong></span>, adventure and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>mischief</strong></span>, and have great intelligence. They often live in the jungle, mostly in tropical rain forests, and jump from tree to tree to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>seek out</strong></span> food and play. The diet of a monkey includes nuts, berries, fruits, anything that smells good, and not to mention, bananas, which is always at the top of their list.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, back to the main point, the first time I saw a ‘real’ monkey was a long time ago, when I was in secondary school. My friends and I travelled to a mountain located somewhere on the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>outskirts</strong> </span>of Hanoi, and when we were climbing the mountain, suddenly a group of small monkeys appeared in the middle of the road ahead in the distance. They were jumping up and down from trees before they <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>approached</strong> </span>us. Then the monkeys stared at me and my friends as though they wanted to communicate and ask for food, so I decided to give them some of our snacks. They were really cute creatures, you know, their hands are like a mini version of ours, which makes them look like little kids.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, although I’m quite into monkeys, I have to admit that they are unexpectedly <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>sneaky</strong></span>. In some tourist attractions around Vietnam, you can easily spot a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>troop </strong></span>of monkeys stealing food from <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>street vendors</strong></span>, and other <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>unsuspecting</strong> </span>tourists. Unfortunately, there’s nothing we can do but watch them run off into the jungle with our food as they are way faster and smarter than you may think.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Anyway, the trip was truly a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>once-in-a-life-time</strong></span> experience for me as I got to touch and feed wild monkeys. Seeing them <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>first hand</strong> </span>also made me realize that they share more common features with humans than I’d previously thought, which really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>evoked</strong> </span>my curiosity about the theory of how people evolved from apes over millions of years.

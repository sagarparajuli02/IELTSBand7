<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to describe a short but rather exciting tour that I went on last Saturday, which was a bicycle trip around Hoan Kiem Lake, which is also known as Sword Lake, and is one of the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>major scenic spots </strong></span>in Hanoi, the capital city of Vietnam.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I went on this trip with three close friends of mine, and we agreed on riding our bicycles to the Ly Thai To statue at 5am, which was to be our <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>point of departure</strong></span>. I’m actually quite the<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> early riser</strong></span> so I found it pretty easy to get up that early and be there on time.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And luckily the weather that day was really nice. The air was fresh and the <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">tranquillity</span> </strong>of the morning made me feel relaxed but also energetic. We biked around the lake about five times until around 7am when the sun began to rise and the streets started to get crowded. After that, we gathered at our favourite cafe to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>sip on </strong></span>some coffee <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>chat</strong> </span>about our lives.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I really enjoyed that short bike trip due to several reasons. Firstly, it was a great chance for me to see our city from a very different perspective, a peaceful Hanoi without traffic jams and air pollution. I was able to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>escape from the hustle and bustle </strong></span>of the city for a few hours and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>recharge myself </strong></span>to get prepared for a new week.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I think that cycling is also a really great exercise that helps me to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>strengthen my health</strong>, <strong>build up stamina </strong></span>and <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">improve my immune system</span>. </strong>And <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>last but not least</strong></span>, I think this trip was a really great opportunity for me and my friends to get together and chat about our daily lives. You know, we are often too busy to meet regularly, so times like these are really valuable.</p>

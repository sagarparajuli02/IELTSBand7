<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8&nbsp;</span></strong><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Sample</strong></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>admit</strong></span> that I’m <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>not much of </strong></span>a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>social person</strong></span> – I mean, I am quite shy and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">i<strong>nhibited</strong></span>, so most of the time I tend to avoid talking to strangers. But I do remember a time when I had to talk to a complete stranger, and as I remember it was around 5 years ago, on my very first trip to Ho Chi Minh City. It was just a short conversation but I can still remember it quite well.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I was a 20-year-old freshman back then, and I was unable to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>navigate my way to </strong></span>the HCMC University of Education where I was about to start studying. Back then Google Map’s wasn’t as popular as it is nowadays, so the only way I could figure out the way was by asking a local. So after hours of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>wandering around</strong></span>, I finally <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>resorted to </strong></span>asking a lady who was selling noodles at a food cart near where I was standing. I asked the lady if she would be so kind to tell me the way to the HCMC University of Education and she kindly replied by pointing to the big building across the road and saying ’it’s over there’.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">The university was being <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>renovated</strong></span> back then, so I was unable to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>recognise</strong></span> it, but before I went off to study I decided to sit down and order some noodles from the old lady and have a chat with her. It turns out that she was also from Ninh Thuan, which is my hometown. So we ended up chatting for ages about our lives and about how and why we had come to HCMC.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">You know, I think I found this conversation so interesting simply because I found Mrs Kim to be such a nice lady. &nbsp;As the conversation went on and I got to know her better I realized that she had had quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a tough life</strong></span>, yet she had managed to maintain such a sweet and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>gentle</strong></span> personality that many other women who have been through similar <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>struggles</strong></span> to her would have lost by now.

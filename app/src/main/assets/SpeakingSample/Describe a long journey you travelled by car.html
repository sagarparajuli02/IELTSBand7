<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to describe quite a long but exciting journey that I went on last week by car from my hometown, Hue city, to the capital city, Hanoi.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I had three <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>travelling companions </strong></span>in the car with me, who were three of my close friends and we had agreed on <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>gathering</strong> </span>at my house at 5am, which was our <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>point of departure</strong></span>. Actually, I’m quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>an early riser</strong>,</span> so I found it quite easy to get up that early and be ready on time.&nbsp; And luckily, the weather that day was really nice, so we were able to leave the windows down for most of the trip. The fresh air and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>tranquillity</strong></span> of the countryside made me feel really relaxed but energetic at the same time.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">After driving all day, we arrived in Hanoi quite late, by around 6:30pm and continued to drive around the lake a few times, until about 7pm, when the sun began to set and the streets became a little quieter. After that, we stopped at our favourite cafe to<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> sip on</strong></span> some coffee and <strong>reflect on </strong>our long day.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I really enjoyed that car trip because of several reasons. To begin with, it was a great chance for me to see my country from a very different angle, a road trip with my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>mates</strong></span>. Usually I would take the train or a plane to complete that journey. So this was a great way to see things, stopping whenever we liked, if we saw something that interested us, for example. This car trip also helped me to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>refresh my mind</strong></span> by just <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hitting the open road</strong></span> and leaving all my worries behind. It was also a really great opportunity for me and my friends to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>enjoy each other’s company</strong></span> and exchange stories along the way from our daily lives. You know, we are often too busy to meet regularly, so chances like this are really valuable.

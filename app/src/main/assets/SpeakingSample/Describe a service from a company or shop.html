<p style="text-align: justify;">Hmn, this is indeed an interesting question. Well, regarding some excellent service that I received, I must say that I was really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>impressed by </strong></span>a company called Traveloka, which provided me with a booking service for flight tickets and a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hotel reservation</strong></span>.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Last summer, my mother and I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>made up our mind </strong></span>to go on a trip to Taiwan. Previously, we would just simply book a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>package tour </strong></span>from a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>travel agent </strong></span>and they would take care of all the expenses and<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"> <strong>itinerary</strong></span> for us. However, this time both me and my mom wanted to do everything on our own, from booking the plane tickets to choosing the hotel and planning the trip.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to a friend’s recommendation, I tried booking flight tickets online, from a website called Traveloka.com. This website is a product of the Traveloka company, which aims to provide a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>user-friendly</strong> <strong>platform</strong></span> for users to search and book flight tickets and hotel rooms.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first I<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"> <strong>held a lot of doubt over</strong></span> this website since I had never bought plane tickets online before. However, after browsing through the site for a while, I was quite impressed by the sites’ <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>smartly designed layout </strong></span>and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>easy-to-follow </strong></span>content, and furthermore, it only took a few minutes to find the plane tickets that I wanted. Another good point to mention about the service was how quickly and convenient the payment was. They offered a variety of payment methods, such as credit card, bank transfer or direct debit, which would suit many different customers’ needs.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Thanks to Traveloka, I managed to book the plane tickets at a reasonable price and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>at lightning speed</strong>.</span> Both my mother and I were completely satisfied with the service that we received, and we gave the website a 5 star rating on the user review page. I would also recommend this site to other friends of mine.

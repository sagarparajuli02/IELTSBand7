<p style="text-align: justify;">I’m going to talk about the time when I received the official notification of my scholarship to join an exchange program in Japan about three years ago. It feels like a long time ago but I can still remember the day quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>vividly</strong>.</span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At that time, I was a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>soph0more</strong></span> at university and one day I came across an advertisement for a two-month <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>cultural exchange</strong> <strong>program</strong></span> in Japan for students from Southeast Asia. I was really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>eager</strong></span> to apply for this program and luckily my application was accepted and I was also <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>nominated</strong></span> for a scholarship.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">So about 2 months later, I received an email from the Scholarship Committee informing me that I had been chosen to receive a full scholarship which would cover all kinds of fees and living expenses for me during the program. I think <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>my heart skipped a beat</strong></span> and I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>screamed out loud</strong></span> when I saw the word “Congratulations” in that email. I was really proud of myself to be chosen from hundreds of candidates to win this scholarship.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It was definitely the best news of the year. If I hadn’t won the scholarship, my living expenses would have been such a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>heavy</strong> <strong>financial burden</strong></span> for my parents, but thanks to the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>generous</strong></span> grants that I received, I could really enjoy my time in Japan without worrying about the money. To this day I still keep this lucky email in my inbox to remind me of that special occasion.

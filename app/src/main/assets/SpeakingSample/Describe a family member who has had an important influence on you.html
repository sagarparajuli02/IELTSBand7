</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am going to talk about my mother who has played <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>an essential role</strong></span> in my life. She is my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>guardian</strong></span>, my friend and my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>role model.</strong></span>
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">My mother is in her forties now, but she still <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>maintains a youthful look</strong></span>. In terms of personality, she is an extremely <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>compassionate</strong></span> and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>kind-hearted</strong></span> person who always takes care of her children. She really is a mother and a friend to me as she always gives me valuable advice and is willing to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>stand by me</strong></span> through all <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>the ups and downs</strong></span> of my life. Although sometimes she <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>drives me crazy</strong></span> due to her being a perfectionist, I still hold so much pride and respect for her.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I am also influenced by her <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>strong-will</strong></span>. Ever since she was young, she had to learn to be <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>independent</strong></span> as my grandparents were very busy and constantly <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>on the go</strong></span>. She had to take care of almost everything: her younger brother, household chores and herself. Such challenges <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>shaped her</strong></span> into the strong person that she is now.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Her <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>determination</strong></span>, as well as her <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">perseverance</span>,</strong> are really something for us to look up to. And I keep reminding myself every day to be as strong as my mother, <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">a real-life “wonder woman</span>.”</strong>

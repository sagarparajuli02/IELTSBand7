<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>&nbsp;<span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well, the first person who came to my mind is my grandmother. She is almost in her 80’s and she has always been a major influence on me.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I guess I could say that I’ve known my grandmother my whole life because she was actually there the day I was born, and after the death of my grandfather she started to live in our house, so I was lucky enough to grow up and pass my <strong>adolescent</strong> years with her love and affection.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since my childhood, she has always cared and loved me with all of her heart, and she is a really kind and <strong>wise</strong> woman which is why I always <strong>turn to her for advice</strong>. I think she’s a <strong>compassionate</strong> person with a big heart, and always tries to help others whenever she can, and I can recall many occasions when she took great risks to help other people out.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">She’s also a successful mother of four children, one of whom is my father. She has <strong>devoted</strong> her entire life for the <strong>betterment</strong> of her kids, educating and guiding them to become good people. She possesses a very <strong>charming</strong> personality and always pleases everyone around her. Even a stranger can feel the warmth of her heart within only a short time.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I could really talk about her all day long because I love and admire her for many reasons. But I must say, the most important reason is her <strong>unconditional love</strong> for me. She is a great <strong>mentor</strong> who always shows me the positive side of things and guides me through my hardest times. Talking to her is a <strong>soothing </strong>experience and the stories she tells are always informative and full of important lessons and <strong>morals</strong>. I think she has had a great influence on my attitude in life and on my personality, and for all these reasons there’s a strong bond between us, and I admire her very much.</p>

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I am going to talk about a newly-opened <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>convenience store</strong></span> in my neighbourhood called Circle K. Actually, Circle K is an extremely popular <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>chain-store</strong></span> from America and has multiple <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>outlets</strong> </span>around Hanoi now.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But the Circle K that I’m speaking about was recently built only a couple of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>blocks</strong> </span>away from where I live and I noticed it as soon as it was built. Also, because of its <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>eye-catching</strong> </span>logo with a giant, red letter K in a white circle, it’s quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hard to miss</strong></span>.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I think that the main reason that I became a regular customer of Circle K was because of one particular item that they sell in their stores, and I was <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>on cloud nine</strong></span> when I discovered it, my favourite alcoholic drink, Vodka Cruiser.&nbsp; You know Cruiser’s only contain 4.5% alcohol which is perfect for a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>lightweight</strong></span> like me. And so, after my discovery, Circle K pretty much became a regular <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>hangout spot</strong></span> of mine where my buddies and I would sometimes meet up and sit outside the store with a couple of Cruiser’s <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>chatting</strong> </span>about our lives and stuff. It’s actually kind of embarrassing but Circle K is the place where I come to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>let off some steam</strong></span> after a break up or some other <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>big drama</strong></span> I have in my life.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So yeah, as long as Circle K still keeps on selling Vodka Cruisers, it will always be my favourite shop.

    <p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Band 8&nbsp;Sample</strong></span>
    </p><p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to describe a really exciting tour that I went on last Saturday, which was a bicycle trip around Hoan Kiem Lake, also known as Sword Lake, which is one of the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>major scenic spots </strong></span>in Hanoi.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I went on this trip with three <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>travelling companions</strong>,</span> who were all close friends of mine, and we agreed on riding our bicycles to the Ly Thai To statue at 5 am, which was our <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>point of departure</strong>.</span> I’m actually quite <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>an early riser</strong></span> so I found it quite easy to get up that early and be there on time.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">And luckily the weather that day was really nice. The air was fresh and the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>tranquillity </strong></span>of the morning made me feel relaxed but energetic. We biked around the lake five times until about 7am when the sun began to rise and the streets started to get crowded. After that, we <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>gathered</strong></span> at our favourite cafe to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>sip on </strong></span>cups of strong coffee and to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>chitchat</strong></span>.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I really enjoyed that bike trip due to several reasons. Firstly, it was a great chance for me to see our city from a very different perspective, a peaceful Hanoi without traffic jams and air pollution. I was able to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>escape from the hustle and bustle </strong></span>of the city for a few hours and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>refresh myself </strong></span>to get prepared for a new week.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I think that cycling is also a really great exercise that helps me to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>strengthen my health</strong></span>, build up my<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> stamina </strong></span>and <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">improve the immune system</span>. </strong>And last but not least, I think this trip was a really great opportunity for me and my friends to get together and chat about our daily lives. You know, we are often too busy to meet regularly, so times like these are really valuable.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today I would like to tell you about crepes, one of the most popular French street foods that I have been <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>longing to </strong></span>try.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I first became interested in this food after learning about it through a TV program that I watched about a year ago on different cultures around the world. The show gave a really detailed description of how to prepare this dish, what ingredients are required, the different stuffings that are used to make different types of crepes, and why this food is so closely related to French culture. I was watching with <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>utmost</strong> </span>interest and attention and immediately jumped onto my computer to do some more research about it after the show ended.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It’s said that, walking around Paris you can locate street stands selling crepes everywhere and that this dish is a really tasty afternoon snack <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>to indulge in</strong></span> before dinner without <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>ruining your appetite</strong></span>. And even though it is not that hard to find a crepe shop in Hanoi, I believe the taste cannot be compared to the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>authentic</strong> </span>recipe that only street stands or restaurants in France are <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>capable of delivering</strong></span>.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Since watching this program, the idea of walking down the street in Paris while enjoying a delicious crepe has been on the top of my <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>wish-list</strong></span> ever since, and I’ve been saving up money recently hoping that I get to fulfil this dream sometime soon.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Well, I would like to talk about The Walking Dead, which is an American television drama series I have recently become crazy about.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">As you might know, The Walking Dead is the most popular TV show <strong>on air </strong>at the moment and everybody <strong>across the globe </strong>is watching it. It <strong>portrays</strong> the world after a zombie <strong>apocalypse</strong>, where society has <strong>crumbled</strong> and there is no government anymore to take care of the people’s <strong>welfare</strong>.&nbsp; I first watched this series about 3 years ago and I immediately fell in love with it, and since then I’ve become really fond of horror movies as well.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The show stars many talented and famous actors, which is one of the main reasons why I love this series. Andrew Lincoln is the actor who plays the <strong>leading role </strong>of a police officer and I think he leaves the most significant impression on the <strong>audience</strong> and me, mainly because of his <strong>outstanding</strong> acting skills and the <strong>devotion</strong> he puts into every scene.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Interestingly enough, my favourite part about this show is the <strong>make-up </strong>of the various kinds of zombies, with each and every one of them having to go through an <strong>elaborate</strong> makeup process to achieve the extremely realistic looks they are able to get.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So as I was saying earlier, I really have had a great interest in the idea of a Zombie apocalypse ever since I was a kid and I even dreamt of living in one once. But apart from that though, I think that this series has a very <strong>stimulating</strong> <strong>plot</strong> and many <strong>unexpected twists</strong> which raise great <strong>suspense</strong> and excitement for viewers.</p>						
					
<p style="text-align: justify;">I just simply cannot get enough of this show and I can’t wait for the opening of the next season.

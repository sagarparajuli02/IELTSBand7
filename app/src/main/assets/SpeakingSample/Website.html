<h4 style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff6600;"><strong></strong><strong>Describe a website that you like and use a lot. Please say:</strong></span></h4>
<ul>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What is the website?</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>How did you find it?</strong></li>
<li style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why do you like it</strong><strong>?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Sample answer: </strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The website that I frequently visit is ted.com, which is spelled T-E-D .com. It’s a website where people can get access to a great number of videos. There are frequent speeches and talks given by <strong>inspirational people</strong> who aim to motivate the youngsters and also to share their <strong>fresh perspectives</strong> with them. In addition, TED helps to <strong>keep people informed with</strong> the latest technology and with what is happening around the globe.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I discovered this website when I was in grade 7. The occasion happened when I was searching for the information for my presentation about the wonders of the world. As I surfed the Internet, I learned about this amazingly <strong>informative</strong> website. It offered me a wide range of knowledge regarding the world’s natural wonders . I remember listening a <strong>lecturer </strong>from England: he talked about how the benefits of those wonders’ tourism had affected people’s minds about conserving the natural beauty and protecting our surroundings.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I really love TED because I not only use it on academic purpose but also consider it when I need some source of entertainment. Like, whenever I feel stressed or depressed and need to figure things out, TED is my <strong>getaway</strong> from life. When I listen to those great minds, I feel like I’m motivated; I’m pushed again to <strong>pluck up courage</strong> to take on new challenges. So that’s basically why TED really <strong>comes in handy</strong> for me.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do you like online shopping? </strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">&nbsp;Well, yes! It is becoming more and more popular nowadays and is a part of our lives. I use it quite often and just bought a new wallet last week by means of online shopping.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>What are the advantages and disadvantages of online shopping?</strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">One of the most obvious <strong>benefits we may reap</strong> is the wide range of choices offered by online shopping, compared to the narrow one by traditional shopping. We don’t have to spend a huge amount of time visiting different stores just to buy our favorite products like before.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">However, due to the <strong>inundated information</strong> on the Internet, choosing a reliable website is not an easy task.&nbsp; We have to be fully aware of shops that lie customers about the quality of their goods. Thus, I suggest checking the products carefully before purchasing them.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Do you think online shopping will increase or decrease in the future?</strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I think it will definitely increase as technology step by step influences on every aspect of our <strong>day-to-day lives</strong>.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;"><strong>Why so?</strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The world’s population is growing at a high rate and therefore, I think department stores and shopping mall will <strong>be demolished</strong> to make room for new houses and apartment blocks to be built. The Internet then will be a new house for products to be sold. Also, despite some drawbacks, online shopping is far more <strong>time-saving</strong> than traditional shopping. And as a matter of fact, &nbsp;people will turn to something that brings them more benefits.

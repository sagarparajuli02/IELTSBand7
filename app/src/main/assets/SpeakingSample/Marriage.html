<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Band 8 Sample</strong></span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I would like to talk about my own parents whose marriage is, <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>without a doubt</strong></span>, a happy one. They have been married for 30 years now and are the perfect couple in my eyes.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Well, my mother and father are now in their 60’s and they are still really busy with their <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>nine to five jobs</strong> </span>in a government office, but I think that both of them are going to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>retire</strong></span> later this year. During 30 years of marriage, my parents have <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>been through thick and thin</strong></span> together but have never lost their love for each other. My parents usually just show their affection simply by always being honest with each other and sharing their <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>true feelings</strong></span>. Their <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>mutual understanding</strong></span> for each other is so <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>profound</strong></span> that sometimes it only takes one look to realise what the other is thinking.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Of course they still have minor<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> tiffs </strong></span>every now and then, you know, things like who will have to pick up the kids or who gets the TV remote. However, my dad is always the first one to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>give in</strong></span> and turn to comfort my mother. I think little action’s like these are actually <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>the key</strong></span> to my parents’ <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>long lasting</strong></span> relationship.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">To me, mom and dad are a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>perfect match</strong></span> and I admire their love for each other so much. Hopefully, in the future, I will have a partner that cares for me as much as my parents care for each other.

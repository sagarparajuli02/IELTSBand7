<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Band 8&nbsp;Sample</strong></span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">So today I am going to tell you about an important <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>milestone</strong></span> in my life which was the first argument I had with my parents. Firstly let me explain why I took this experience so seriously. I’m usually a real <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>mama’s boy</strong></span> who always obeys my parents, especially my mom who is definitely the stricter of the two. She is so bossy and direct that it usually has to be <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>her way or the highway</strong></span>. And also, my mother is <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>awfully protective</strong></span> of me and never allows me to have or join in any <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>sleepover</strong> </span>whatsoever. And that leads to the main part of my story, which happened three weeks ago.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">It was my best friend’s birthday party and he invited me to sleep over at his house. I was so <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>thrilled</strong></span>. I mean this was going to be my first sleepover. My excitement did not last long though as my mum immediately said no when I brought it up. Filled with anger, I found myself <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>raising my voice </strong></span>at my mother for the first time in my life and said “Mom, I am a 21-year-old man. I can take care of myself”. She was so surprised at my response and scolded me even harder. But I stood my ground. I believed it was about time I expressed my feelings and let her know how I felt. I felt that I was old enough to be responsible for myself and my mom needed to stop protecting me. Finally, she understood and let me go.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">But I will never forget that day when I would <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>go against</strong></span> my mother’s decision and also the fact that I got super<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> wasted</strong> </span>that night and was grounded for the next two months.

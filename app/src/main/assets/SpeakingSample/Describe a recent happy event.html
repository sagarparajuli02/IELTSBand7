<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p>I would like to talk about a special wedding that I recently attended, which was my brother’s wedding, which is possibly one of the happiest events in my entire life. It was only 2 months ago and I still remember that day rather clearly.
</p><p>My brother, who is my only <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>sibling</strong></span>, decided to get married in the summer of 2017. And since my brother’s<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> fiancée</strong> </span>is a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>Catholic</strong></span>, the wedding was a combination of both catholic and traditional Vietnamese style. Because we were on the groom’s side, my family and I had to wake up early to follow my brother to his bride’s house. There my brother would ask for permission from his future <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>parents-in-law</strong></span> to allow him to take their daughter to her new family. After getting the acceptance, both the bride and groom and all the guests headed to a fancy restaurant, where the wedding ceremony was celebrated. I remembered how well the entire room was decorated with sparkling light bulbs and purple ribbons, which was the bride’s favourite colour. During the whole ceremony, myself and other guests witnessed the bride and groom <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>exchanging vows</strong></span> with each other and this was indeed an unforgettable moment.
</p><p>Also, this marriage was special for me in another sense, being that it was the first wedding I had had the chance to be a part of, which really made the whole event <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a once-in-a-life-time experience</strong></span>. It was really great to be able to see and feel the passionate love the couple had for each other, through the way they looked at each other and the through the way they expressed their vows. And finally, the wedding was carried out with a smooth and peaceful atmosphere and I think that all the guests really had a great time attending this sacred occasion.

<p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>BAND 8 Sample </strong></span>
</p>
<p>I would like to talk about the telephone which, in my opinion, is one of the most <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>revolutionary creations</strong></span> that has changed our lives.
</p>
<p>As far as I know, Alexander Graham Bell was <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>the father</strong> <strong>of</strong></span> this terrific device and he invented it in the last century through a lot of <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">trial and error</span>.</strong>
</p>
<p>It is no <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>exaggeration</strong></span> to say that human life has completely changed since the first telephone was <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>devised</strong></span>. A few centuries ago people could only communicate long distances through writing letters, which could <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>take ages</strong></span> to be delivered. And in the case of emergencies or <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>confidential </strong></span>information, writing letters really wasn’t an effective way of communicating.
</p>
<p>So, one of the main reasons that I believe that the telephone has changed people’s lives is simply by making communication between people so much faster, easier and more convenient than ever before. These days when you need <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>to get in contact with somebody</strong></span>, all you need to do is pick up your phone, dial a few numbers and wait for them to answer. And if they don’t answer, then you can usually just leave a voice message for them to let them know what it is you wanted to tell them.
</p>
<p>Furthermore, I believe that communication is <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>at the core of</strong></span> social development, and I think that the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>advent</strong></span> of the telephone has made <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a great contribution</strong></span> to this area of life.
</p>
<p>So, whether the information is urgent, confidential, or even <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>down right</strong></span> unnecessary, I think that the telephone has made a massive difference to people’s lives and our societies as well.

</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Well, I would like to share with you about a really <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>pleasant</strong></span> experience in an English class I had at my university.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">During one of our grammar lessons, the regular teacher was sick so the school had to send in a teacher to cover her place. And the <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>substitute</strong></span> teacher, Thomas Hall, delivered an amazing lecture in English about how he thinks we should all learn languages through watching films.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Throughout the two hours, he explained to us the process of learning a language and how films can <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>serve</strong></span> as an effective way to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>immerse </strong></span>yourself in a language. Basic <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>elements</strong></span> like vocabulary and grammar can be easily <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>absorbed</strong></span> if we <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>focus</strong></span> on <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>dialog</strong></span> in a TV show, and so in <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>the long run</strong></span>, our overall language skills can be improved. This method helps us to learn any language <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>effortlessly </strong></span>and in a short period of time.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">At first, we were all <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>sceptical </strong></span>about the ideas he introduced, however, after watching a short video to practice and doing a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>trial</strong></span> test, we were all convinced that learning by watching movies was not hard at all and we could apply this to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>enhance</strong></span> our performance at school.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I enjoyed this lesson so much because I find this method to be particularly effective for me. I always felt <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>unmotivated </strong></span>when learning by traditional methods and my results were never <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>desirable</strong></span>. But when I tried learning English using my favourite movies, you know what? My English got better and better and very soon I was able to remember thousands of new words and write really complicated essays. Now, I can even proudly say that I have mastered the English language.

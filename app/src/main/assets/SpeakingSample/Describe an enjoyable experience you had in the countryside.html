    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">I would like to talk about last summer when I had an
        unforgettable opportunity to visit my hometown, which is a small village located in the
        north of Vietnam.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">My entire family, including my parents, myself and my younger
        sister, decided to spend the day driving to the village. For my parents, this would be the
        chance for them to see their relatives who they hadn’t seen in a long time. And for me and
        my sister, we hoped to <strong>get a closer insight into </strong>the life of the locals as
        well as <strong>strengthen our family bonds</strong>.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">So, the four of us <strong>hit the road</strong> really early in
        the morning, at about 5 a.m. And after about 4 hours of driving, we arrived at a peaceful
        and tranquil village. To my <strong>astonishment</strong> the scenery was completely
        different from the neighbourhood where I currently live. We admired the <strong>breathtaking
            landscapes</strong> of green paddy fields, winding paths and small houses standing next
        to each other. After that we went to visit our relatives who were all really friendly and
        <strong>warm-hearted</strong> people and greeted us with great <strong>enthusiasm</strong>.
        The whole morning was spent talking and chatting about our lives and old memories. At noon,
        our family was treated to a <strong>gourmet meal,</strong> full of local and <strong>organically
            grown</strong> ingredients. In the afternoon, one of our relatives took us to see the
        paddy fields and the village’s famous lake. My sister and I got to learn how to fish and
        feed the chickens, which was <strong>a novel experience</strong> since we had never done
        this before.
    </p>
    <p style="text-align: justify;">All of us were <strong>over the moon</strong> the whole day,
        which really was a once in a life time experience and would be <strong>embedded</strong> in
        our memory for a long time.

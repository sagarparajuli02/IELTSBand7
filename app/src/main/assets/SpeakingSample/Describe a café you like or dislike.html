<p style="text-align: justify;">The <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>fast pace</strong></span> of modern life in the city can be too much for an <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>introvert</strong> </span>like myself and I sometimes desire some time to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>retire into my shell</strong></span> and take a little <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>retreat</strong></span>. Fortunately, I found the perfect place called “Secret garden” which I am going to share with you right now.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">“Secret garden” is a garden <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>themed</strong> </span>coffee shop located on the rooftop of a building in the centre of Hanoi. The café is well-known for its <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>floral</strong> </span>and <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">botanical</span> </strong>inspired design, which gives you a sense of peace and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>tranquillity</strong> </span>while enjoying some cake and coffee at the same time.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">I have become a frequent guest there and usually go on the weekend. My favourite activities in this coffee shop are reading books while listening to relaxing <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>instrumental music</strong></span>, having a warm cup of tea with cookies or simply just sitting in the <strong><span style="background-color: #ffcc00;">exterior</span> </strong>garden and enjoying the view.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">Despite being popular, the coffee shop’s still able to manage a quiet and soft <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>atmosphere</strong></span>. <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>The setting</strong></span> is perfect with relaxing music, and the staff are really well-trained and cater to the guests’ needs quite well. Also, other guests there are usually really quite respectful and generally don’t disturb other people by talking or laughing too loudly.
</p>
<p style="text-align: justify;">It’s <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>rare</strong> </span>to find a place like this in Hanoi and I always recommend it to my friends who need a break from the busy city life.

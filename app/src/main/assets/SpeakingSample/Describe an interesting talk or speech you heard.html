<p style="text-align: justify;"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Band 8&nbsp;Sample</strong></span>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today I am going to talk to you about a speech that I <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>came across </strong></span>two months ago on TV called “the power of <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>vulnerability</strong></span>”.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The speech was <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>delivered by</strong> </span>Brene Brown who is an American <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>scholar</strong></span>, an author and a <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>public speaker</strong></span>. She has been involved in research on a range of topics, including vulnerability, courage, shame, and empathy.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I accidentally heard her speech when I was watching TV at home after a hard day at work. Her TED talk <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>touched my spirit</strong>, <strong>evoked my sympathy</strong></span> and taught me many lessons. Firstly, I learnt that I cannot ignore all the negative feelings I have. If I try to avoid them, I won’t be able to feel happy, grateful or joyful, and therefore, I need to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>have the courage to face</strong> </span>and solve all the problems I have in order to live happily.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Secondly, thanks to this talk, I was able to understand how powerful it is to show other people my vulnerability, and that I should dare to <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>take risks</strong></span> and do the things that I am not so sure about. For example, I should be the one who says I love you first, even if I know I might be rejected.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Finally, I learnt how to love myself<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"> <strong>from the bottom of my heart</strong></span> and was able to give up irresponsible behaviour such as <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>skipping meals</strong> or <strong>getting wasted</strong></span> whenever I was sad. And in addition to this, once I’m able to love myself, I won’t hurt other people who truly love me.

<p style="text-align: justify;"><strong> <span style="color: #ff0000;">Band 8 Sample</span></strong>
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Today, I am going to talk about the twin sisters that live next-door to my apartment.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The twins moved into the apartment about one year ago with their parents. We came to know each other when the electricity in our building was <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>cut off</strong></span> one evening and unfortunately, I had run out of candles and my torch was nowhere to be found. So I had to go to the apartment next door to ask for some candles, and this was when I first met them. They were extremely helpful and enthusiastic and they even let me stay at their place until the power was back on. I was really<span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong> grateful </strong></span>for their help and a few days later, I made some snacks for them as a thank-you gift and invited them over to my place for <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>a sleep-over</strong></span>. Since then, we have become really close friends.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Even though they are twins, they look nothing alike. The older one has a short, bob haircut and a real <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>mischievous grin</strong></span>. A true <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>social butterfly</strong></span>, I would say. Meanwhile, her younger sister always ties her long straight hair into a ponytail with a ribbon and always has a very <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>sheepish</strong></span> look on her face and is a bit more shy and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>reserved</strong></span>. Despite the different <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>vibes</strong> </span>that each one has, they both are very mentally and physically attractive in their own <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>unique</strong> </span>ways.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">Ever since the twins came into my life, sleepovers and <span style="background-color: #ffcc00;"><strong>movie marathons</strong></span> have become a regular activity every weekend, and the talk never gets boring because each of them has such a different personality. I hope my friendship with them lasts a lifetime.

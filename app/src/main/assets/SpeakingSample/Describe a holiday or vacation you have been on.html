</p><p style="text-align: justify;">A few months ago, I went to the South of Vietnam for a vacation with my family. It’s was to the lovely <strong>coastal city</strong> of Nha Trang, which is also a very famous tourist destination. We decided to go there by plane since it is nearly 1200 kilometres from Hanoi, and would take a long time by car or train.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">I was so eager for the trip that I prepared everything such as my clothes, camera and other accessories a week <strong>in advance</strong>. It took about an hour to fly there, and luckily, the flight took off <strong>on time</strong>. The trip began with an <strong>incredible</strong> view from the airplane window and I can still remember being quite <strong>overwhelmed</strong> by the beauty of my city from above and the amazing sunset.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The time we spent in Nha Trang was <strong>a blast</strong>. We got to try out so many new things such as <strong>skydiving</strong>, surfing, and diving to see the coral reef. This place has one of the most beautiful beaches in Vietnam with deep blue water and pearly-white sand. Also, the food there was so <strong>unique</strong> and delicious. I think the most memorable moment of that trip though was definitely when we bought fresh ingredients from a local market and grilled them by the beach. Sitting there by the fire on a <strong>breezy</strong> night with the delicious smell freshly barbequed fish was an amazing experience.
</p><p style="text-align: justify;">The trip to Nha Trang really was the holiday of a lifetime. We had a lot of fun and got to see a lot of <strong>spectacular</strong> scenery. We definitely enjoyed it and we will definitely go there again if we have a chance.

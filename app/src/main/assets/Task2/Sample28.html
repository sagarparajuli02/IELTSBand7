At advanced academic levels, writers will structure complex paragraphs to reflect complex lines of argument. However, under the time and word limits of IELTS Writing Task 2, it is more practical to follow a relatively simple paragraph format, which allows the reader to identify the main idea, the development of this idea in the form of explanation or examples, and a concluding or transition sentence which leads into the following paragraph.</p>

    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">Although the care of children has traditionally been the role of women, nowadays many men have decided to stay at home to raise children while the woman in the family goes to work. However, some people believe that women have a natural ability for childcare and this role should be left to them. I disagree with this for the following reasons.</p>
    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">Firstly, both men and women have qualities which are important for bringing up and educating children. These qualities are not specific to men or women, therefore both genders are able to raise children successfully. By saying that childcare is a specific female role, children will receive a message which portrays women as carers only. For example, young girls who are taught to believe that the place of women is in the home may not try hard in school subjects which are more male dominated, such as science.</p>
    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">Secondly, the role of women in the workplace has changed significantly in the last fifty years. Many women now hold senior positions in many areas of employment. Women contribute a range of skills to the workplace which are both valuable and important. In my opinion, women should continue to focus on their careers and ensure that their daughters are aware of the opportunities which are available to them in life. Men should also take on some of the responsibility of childcare and teach their sons that this is a valuable role in society for men as well as women.</p>
    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">In conclusion, it is important that men and women share childcare duties because both genders have important qualities and skills. However, women and men should also be allowed to focus on their careers and provide strong role models for children.</p>

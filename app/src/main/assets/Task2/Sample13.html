                <li style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.8;">When you first read each IELTS tasks it is helpful to spend some time before you start writing to work out the key elements of the task. One way to do this is to try to paraphrase them, i.e. think of a different way to express the same point.</li>
                <li style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.8;">Although the quality of your English is the most important thing being assessed you will also need to show that you can discuss the topic in a relevant way. If you write about irrelevant points, your marks will be significantly reduced.</li>
                <li style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.8;">Don&apos;t copy the question. Use your own words to introduce your essay. This is a fairly easy way to gain marks because assessors will be interested to see how well you can paraphrase in English.</li>
                <li style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 0px; padding: 0px 0px 0.5em; line-height: 1.8;">It is important to remember than in the IELTS writing exam it is your English and your ability to write a well-developed argument which is being assessed, not the quality of your ideas.</li>

    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">It would be difficult to imagine life without computers. Over recent years in particular, their use and potential have grown at an incredible rate and I strongly believe that this growth will continue as more innovative ways to use them are developed. Although there are definitely some downsides to their use, I do believe the positives outweigh the negatives.</p>
    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">Computers enable us to do a wealth of tasks that would have been unthinkable for previous generations. We can bank online, book holidays, do our weekly shopping - the list of labour-saving activities is almost endless. Given the speed at which they have evolved and altered the way we do things, I am convinced that this evolutionary trend will continue. Take, for example, the rise of virtual reality. We can already do amazing things with it, and, as a computer-based technology, it is only in its infancy. It has so many practical applications, from improving gaming to providing training for doctors or pilots to handle real-life situations. As computer processing power increases, so will its potential to enhance everything we do.</p>
    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">Despite this, there are dangers in relying quite so heavily on computers. So much of our daily lives is controlled by them, that without them, modern-day life as we know it would be impossible. Furthermore, computers store all our important data and the risk of hacking exposes us to crimes such as fraud. However, I would argue that the technological advances made possible by computers have improved our world in so many ways. I believe that most people would argue that that any negative aspects of computers are outweighed by all the benefits they have brought.</p>
    <p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin: 1em 0px; padding: 0px;">In conclusion, I believe we will probably become more dependent on computers but that our lives will improve as the technology improves. While there is a negative side to such a dependency, there are many more positives that we can focus on.</p>
